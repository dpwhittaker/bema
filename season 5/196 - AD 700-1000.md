# BEMA Episode 196: AD 700-1000

## Episode Overview
This episode covers three pivotal centuries of church history, examining the Iconoclastic Controversy, the East-West Schism, and the contributions of Charlemagne. Marty and Brent explore how fundamental differences between Eastern and Western worldviews led to the great division of Christendom.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Iconoclastic Controversy
The Byzantine Church faced a major disagreement over the use of images and icons in worship. This controversy stemmed from fundamental differences between Eastern and Western mindsets:

- **Eastern worldview**: Communicates truth through pictures and images
- **Western worldview**: Communicates truth through words, definitions, and prose

The controversy was about how different cultures preserve and communicate divine truth. Western Christians often misunderstood Eastern Orthodox practices of venerating icons as idolatry, when Eastern worshipers were actually worshiping the God behind the story the icon represents.

### East Versus West: Two Ways of Knowing
The distinction between Eastern and Western thought is crucial for understanding this period:
- The **Western world** wrote down what the Text said and called it doctrine
- The **Eastern world** drew images and pictures to help remember the content, calling them icons
- Both were trying to preserve theological truth in a world without printing presses and with widespread illiteracy

The Easterner could just as easily accuse the Westerner of "doctrinal idolatry" - worshiping doctrine the way Westerners accused Easterners of worshiping icons.

### The Challenge of Preserving Truth
In a pre-printing press world with widespread illiteracy, where church services used Latin or Greek rather than common languages, the church faced a critical question: How do you preserve the Text and its teachings?

- The Western world preserved doctrine by writing it down
- The Eastern world preserved doctrine by painting icons
- Both methods were attempts to maintain theological truth without the Text being internalized as it was in Jewish tradition

### Charlemagne: Father of the West
Charlemagne united the Western Church unlike anyone since Constantine, leading the church toward:
- Intellectual revitalization
- Spiritual renewal
- Progress that set up the scientific revolution

Despite being called the "Dark Ages," this period was far from intellectually dark - it laid groundwork for significant advances. The book "The Genesis of Science" by James Hannam argues these centuries were crucial preparation for the scientific revolution.

### The Great East-West Schism (AD 1054)
At the turn of the first millennium, Christendom tore into two major divisions:
- **Roman Church of the West**: Banking on papal authority and God-ordained power
- **Eastern Orthodox Church**: Refusing Western demands and pronouncements

The schism wasn't a single moment but a process (traditionally dated to 1054, with ongoing tensions until 1472). The Western Church made demands of their Eastern brothers; these demands were refused and denounced.

The departure of the Eastern Church left the Western Church in "shock and terror," as it seemed Christendom might not survive such division.

## Historical Context and Key Events

### The Byzantine Period
- The Byzantine period effectively ended as it concerned the papacy and Holy Roman Church
- The Byzantine Empire was the more Greek part of the Roman world
- When Western Rome fell, the Eastern Empire continued with strong Greek influence

### Unity and Division
The tension between East and West grew increasingly difficult to manage:
- Charlemagne's unity didn't hold under growing tensions
- The Western Church found it impossible to control their Eastern brothers
- The empire was as large as Rome itself, making unity challenging

### Christendom Defined
The podcast explores various definitions of "Christendom":
- **New Oxford American Dictionary**: The worldwide body or society of Christians (a dated term)
- **Church History in Plain Language**: Church and state as two aspects of society - one securing spiritual blessings, the other safeguarding justice and welfare
- **Wikipedia**: Refers to the Christian world, Christian states, and countries where Christianity dominates

Marty uses "Christendom" with a critical connotation, representing Christianity with imperial undertones - starting with Constantine and representing an empire-based expression of faith rather than the apostolic movement.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Iconoclastic Controversy**: The Byzantine dispute over the use of religious images and icons in worship

**Icons**: Images and pictures used in Eastern Christianity to remember and communicate theological content, serving as visual texts

**East-West Schism**: The division of Christendom into the Roman Catholic Church (West) and Eastern Orthodox Church (East), traditionally dated to 1054

**Byzantine Papacy**: The period when the papacy was closely connected to the Byzantine Empire

**Christendom**: Christianity expressed through the lens of empire, with institutional power and political authority (Marty's working definition)

**Liturgy**: Shared patterns of worship created to give all believers a common Christian experience despite lack of literacy or direct text access

## Practical Applications

### Understanding Different Ways of Knowing
Recognize that neither Eastern nor Western approaches to truth are inherently superior - they're simply different ways of preserving and communicating divine truth. This can help us:
- Appreciate diverse Christian traditions
- Avoid judging other expressions of faith through our cultural lens
- Recognize our own cultural blind spots

### Learning from History's Divisions
The East-West Schism reminds us:
- Theological and cultural rigidity can fracture the body of Christ
- Imperial approaches to church unity often backfire
- True unity requires humility and mutual respect

### Questioning Our Own "Christendom"
Consider where we might still be operating from imperial assumptions:
- Do we confuse cultural Christianity with the Kingdom of God?
- Are we more invested in institutional power than gospel witness?
- Where has Christendom not yet ended in our own context?

### Recovering Lost Treasures
Both Eastern and Western traditions have valuable elements:
- The Eastern emphasis on mystery, beauty, and visual theology
- The Western emphasis on clarity, doctrine, and systematic thought
- Both when held together offer a fuller expression of faith

## Study Questions

1. How does understanding the difference between Eastern and Western worldviews help you interpret the Iconoclastic Controversy? What are the dangers of viewing other traditions through only our cultural lens?

2. Marty distinguishes between his love for "the apostolic movement" and his criticism of "Christendom." What is this distinction? Where do you see Christendom (Christianity with imperial undertones) still operating today?

3. The episode notes that both doctrine and icons can become forms of idolatry. How can we guard against turning our preferred methods of knowing God into objects of worship themselves?

4. Why was the preservation of text and doctrine so challenging in a pre-printing press, largely illiterate world? How does this context help us understand the developments of this period?

5. The East-West Schism seemed to threaten the survival of Christianity itself. Yet Christianity endured. What does this teach us about God's work in and through a divided church?

6. Marty asks: "Where did Christendom begin? Where does Christendom end? Has Christendom ended?" How would you answer these questions? What evidence supports your answer?

7. How might experiencing worship in an Eastern Orthodox church challenge or enrich your understanding of Christian faith? What keeps you from such exploration?

8. The episode mentions that the "Dark Ages" weren't actually intellectually dark but set up later advances. How does this reframe your understanding of this period? What other periods of history might we misjudge?

## Key Quote

"Christendom, when I say that, I say it very intentionally and I use it to refer to something with a slightly cynical, slightly critical, slightly negative connotation because Christendom to me represents Christianity with imperial undertones, overtones, and underpinnings. It's grounded in an imperial reality." - Marty Solomon
