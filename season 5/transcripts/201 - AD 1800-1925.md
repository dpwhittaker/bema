AD 1800–1925

**Brent Billings:** This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon, I’m his co-host Brent Billings. Today, we leave the French Revolution behind and move into the modern era. How did we handle our newfound land of freedom and independence? How did it impact our theology and our ecclesiology?

**Marty Solomon:** Alright, we have your typical presentation. We’re going to finish up the timeline that we have had for the last two episodes, and we’re going to start to head into the next timeline that we have for the next little part of your presentation. That’s how we’re moving here. As the age of the revolution changed the cultural setting for Christendom, there was a new push to get our bearings as a faith movement. For almost 1,400 years, the world of Christendom had enjoyed being the privileged default of culture.

If you unplugged Western world and plugged it back in, the default setting would’ve blinked Christian. Now with the rise of the Age of Enlightenment, Christendom’s white-knuckle grip on theology, creeds, and doctrinal truths did not age well. As the world became more and more knowledgeable, more and more educated, more and more literate, simply affirming creedal beliefs wasn’t holding a candle to the scientific method. Before we talk about science, we should talk about this new culture of independence, Brent Billings. The impact it had on our own shores here in #Merica

**Brent:** We made a declaration about it.

**Marty:** We made a declaration. This movement of culture away from Christianity had a positive effect for Christendom as a whole, and an effort to regain what was being lost. Protestant believers fell into what is often referred to as the second great awakening. The first great awakening, you might remember, is usually attributed to the rise of Methodism. We talk about John Wesley. I believe that was the last episode, mid-1700s. This great time of revival was ushered in throughout North America, throughout Europe, and through what we commonly know—this great awakening took place in what was commonly known as camp meetings.

**Brent:** I have been to a camp meeting.

**Marty:** You have been to a camp meeting?

**Brent:** Yes.

**Marty:** Ooh.

**Brent:** Pretty recently.

**Marty:** I learn something new about you every day, Brent Billings.

**Brent:** Yes.

**Marty:** How’d that go?

**Brent:** My good friend, Abby, her dad’s Baptist church had a camp meeting.

**Marty:** Oh, wow.

**Brent:** They had me come and take some pictures.

**Marty:** Wow, that’s cool. Love it. These camp meeting revivals—at least back in the day, I don’t know what it was like when you went there—but these revivals became a time for denominations to come together, enjoy fellowship, worship, and preaching. Such a focus and desire to experience true confession and true repentance would lead to great times of spiritual revival and movement.

**Brent:** That’s pretty much what it was.

**Marty:** You felt that?

**Brent:** Yes.

**Marty:** Wow, that’s cool. Love that. Many attribute the rise of Pentecostalism. What we know as Pentecostalism—and we have Pentecostal listeners, so I’m definitely not using that term in a negative/positive way—just what it is, the rise of Pentecostalism. Many attribute the rise of these experiences where the Holy Spirit seems to be poured out in abundance that is widely accepted.

You can feel that, Brent. Up to this point, we’ve been talking a lot about science, mathematics, academics, systems, and Protestant reformations and it’s like, “Okay, but where’s the art? Where’s the beauty? Where’s the—quite literally—where’s the Holy Spirit in all of this?” These camp meetings and this independence that was starting to thrive the personal individual wanting to follow God with all their heart, all their soul, and all their might, it was leading to the movement of the Holy Spirit.

There was a whole movement to reclaim that, something had been lost. What is widely accepted as the first camp meeting, and it probably wasn’t but what is widely accepted as the first one is held in Kentucky in 1801. It’s a good year for your first one. 1801. I like that. This would set the stage for an invigorated and passionate movement of Protestant parishioners.

[music]

**Marty:** It was this same awakening, coupled with the cultural movement of America towards freedom and independence, that led to Christianity having to jettison denominationalism. As many denominations were attempting to hold onto their imperial moorings through the use of creeds and belief statements, think of a more colonial version of church membership. Think of the Westminster Confession; you will affirm this creed and this confession in order to be a part of the tribe here.

There were entire groups that began kicking against colonialism as it was experienced in the North American church—and I realize this is not like American colonialism. This is a European colonialism that was brought over. If you came over from—if you were a German who migrated, you probably migrated with other what, Brent?

**Brent:** With other Germans.

**Marty:** With other Germans and that whole group was probably…?

**Brent:** Lutheran.

**Marty:** Lutheran. If you weren’t Catholic, if you were Protestant. When you set up your colony, you all got there and you set up a colony together and that colony was largely had, what kind of people as citizens?

**Brent:** German Lutherans.

**Marty:** German Lutherans. Now, if you came from—what were we just talking about the other day? If you came from…?

**Brent:** Scotland as a Presbyterian.

**Marty:** Presbyterian, you set up a Presbyterian Church. I was raised in the RCA, the Reformed Church of America, which we always touted was the oldest denomination in America. One of the first ones to be set up here.

**Brent:** It was the first one I was reading about. I think it was the Puritans maybe.

**Marty:** Well, they were definitely at play. I don’t know, denominationally, how that all worked or played into the denominational landscape.

**Brent:** I think they were fighting against some of the Anglican beliefs and that’s why they came. There was a group of them in England and then another group maybe over in the Netherlands or something. They all got together and came over to America.

**Marty:** Absolutely, yes. It was a very Dutch Reformed Church that I grew up in, in that movement, so absolutely. You have these very geographical, national, colonial identities based on where you came from and how you might make it over, but then you also landed in America, where there was—you brought your culture with you, but you were also building something brand new. That brand new thing was freedom and it was independence. It was something that was alive and it was different than the thing that you brought with you and so those things began to clash.

You would have these old systems that you used to have over in Europe in your church system, but everything around you in the American culture that you were settling and colonizing, was totally different and they weren’t working well together. It was like trying to plant some kind of plant that wasn’t going to grow in that climate and so they were having all kinds of fits. Again, this is a thread that I’m going to follow. I grew up in the Reformation movement. I could follow that thread, but I wasn’t trained in my Reformation background that I was raised in.

I was trained in the Stone-Campbell Movement, what we sometimes call the Restoration Movement, the Christian Church, Church of Christ. That movement, that’s where I’m trained. That’s where I’m going to stick with because that’s where most of my expertise lies. Was raised in the Reformed movement, but was trained and pastored in the Restoration Movement. The Stone-Campbell Movement was one of those new things blossoming as we struggled with independence.

It started when a guy by the name of Barton Stone—called the Stone-Campbell Movement after Barton Stone—a recently ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, was asked to sign the Westminster Confession before he could receive the Eucharist. It’s a somewhat simplified version of the story, but I don’t think I gave you the book, Brent, but we’ll link this book in the show notes. Union in Truth by North. It’s not like it’s a horribly compelling read, but it was my text that I used in college to lead me through the history of the Restoration Movement, if anybody’s really interested.

I don’t look at that book and be like, “That was entertaining,” but it was informative. There you go. Barton Stone, he was asked to sign the Westminster Confession before he could receive the Eucharist, and he was appalled by the use of confession and doctrine in this way. He thought, “No, we shouldn’t have to sign the document before they can receive the bread and the juice.” Stone joined others with similar encounters to restore a sense of the faith experienced in revivals. A faith they associated with the early church in the book of Acts. They wanted to restore that to Christianity in America.

**Brent:** What about Campbell?

**Marty:** A lot of people are going to be—listen, for all of our listeners—we have listeners all over the board from Greek Orthodox to Reformed folks and to Baptists and Anabaptists. Our largest listenership, by far, lands in the Restoration Movement. There’s going to be a lot of listeners that are like, “Oh my gosh, you just did a total disservice by not talking about more of our history.” Trust me, I would love to, and maybe we’ll do a later podcast in Session 6 when we talk about random things here and there. Maybe we’ll dive in deeper to the history of the Restoration Movement and why I love it and why I still love the ideals.

I often hate its application, but I love its ideals that it stood for. We have a lot of things wrong in the application of our movement, but nevertheless—I digress. We’re not going to get into that here, but yes, this movement, you asked about Campbell. Stone is doing his work in part of the country. In the meantime, there’s somebody having a very similar experience, Thomas Campbell. He has a son named Alexander Campbell, who actually stays over in Europe, eventually comes back over.

They’ve been having very similar experiences on both sides of the Atlantic. They’re both afraid to even talk about it. They end up talking about—these groups end up uniting. As Christianity is splintering, one of the beautiful things about the story of the Restoration Movement, is there are all these people experiencing the same thing from different denominational splinters and they actually join together. As everybody is splintering apart, this movement—at least for a period of time—drew everyone together.

Now, they lost that beauty in their movement after a few decades, but at the origins, it’s drawing Stone and Campbell together. Eventually, they end up coming together and uniting this movement into the Stone-Campbell Movement. Two different sides you look through, I’m from the branch that often comes out of—much more like Campbell. But there’s this real beauty that comes out of more of a Stone perspective, all kinds of wonderful nuances.

**Brent:** Well, we don’t have to get into it too much. It is the Stone-Campbell Movement, so I just had to ask about Campbell.

**Marty:** Absolutely.

**Brent:** Because I don’t know anything about it.

**Marty:** Thank you for letting me not get dragged all the way into a three-hour episode on Restoration history.

**Brent:** [chuckles] Three hours? Don’t make any promises like that.

**Marty:** [chuckles] There we go. There’s a whole lot more we could talk about and half of our listeners or more than that are getting really mad that I’m not spending more time on that, but we have a lot of other listeners, so I’m not going to spend time just focusing on that part of the history. In the light of all of this, it’s not a coincidence that other movements start at the same time as well.

Driven by the same disgust in the direction of Christianity, Joseph Smith received his calling in the movement that we know as Mormonism, the Latter-Day Saints, the LDS movement. That started at the same point of history. We also see the work of Ellen G. White, John Darby, and a guy by the name of Charles Russell, who is responsible for the Jehovah’s Witnesses movement.

**Brent:** All three of them are Jehovah’s Witnesses?

**Marty:** Not necessarily. Ellen G. White is going to be more Seventh-Day Adventist, and John—this is really hard, I try not to link these names together. I’m not going to try and make these decisions for everybody. I really hate labels, I don’t think labels are all that helpful, but many of us view some of these movements as definitely more cultic and not orthodox Christian movements at all. I definitely think there are some key distinctions—I’m going to put it that way.

My whole family—everybody is going to get really confused by this. [laughs] They’re going to be like, “Wait a minute. We’ve already been confused that you were raised in a Christian home, but you’re Jewish by heritage.” Now, I’m going to tell you that my whole family is very, very committed LDS, very committed Mormons.

**Brent:** Not your immediate family.

**Marty:** Not my immediate family, but everybody outside of my immediate family on my dad’s side, is very, very committed LDS, so I try to honor them as much as I can. I don’t know how many LDS listeners we might have on our podcast that have made it all the way to this point. I try to be generous and as hospitable as I can be. I do think there are very, very key distinctions between what I’m going to call orthodoxy, in this case, and I love to have those conversations, but I try to be generous with the way I do my podcast.

I think there are some very key distinctions about Charles Russell and Jehovah’s Witnesses. Are there some distinctions with Ellen G. White and Seventh-Day Adventist? Sure, but do I want to put them into the same category? I don’t know. I don’t think categories are all that helpful. I just don’t find them to be helpful. However, objective, critical thinking? That’s helpful. I like that, so I want to encourage a lot of that. There’s a whole conversation about Ellen G. White, John Darby, and Charles Russell. They’re not all linked to Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Charles Russell will be linked to the movement of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Ellen G. White and John Darby were in the same conversation. Different things happened as far as the world of eschatology. I’m not sure how much we’ll get into that. A lot of things are going on. We could talk about a lot of things, but it’s a good clarifying question because I don’t want to lump them all into the same camp.

**Brent:** I don’t really know anything about most of these names, so I don’t know. I don’t know who goes with who, if at all.

**Marty:** Yes, and they’re such good conversations to be had. I know we have Seventh-Day Adventists who listen to our podcast, so I don’t want to offend them, but Ellen G. White was responsible for—whatever you want to call that, I don’t know the language they like to use with it. She had her own revelation. She was seen as the prophet for that movement. She was connected with Darby. Through their connection, there was also another connection with Scofield. People might be familiar with the Scofield Bible.

It was one of the most largely mass-printed, mass-published, mass-produced—it was like the first Study Bible with notes in the margins and ways to help you read the Bible. In my opinion, the Scofield Bible wrecked Christian theology in the modern era. It propagated some teachings that I just think were nonsense and we are now still deconstructing those things. When people have an understanding of the rapture—think Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins in the Left Behind series, not that I want to offend a whole bunch of people, but probably, at this point, it’s probably too late for that.

That whole eschatological worldview came out of this Scofield Bible and Christianity as a whole accepted that as a default understanding of theology, and it was not the orthodox default, coming up to this point. It’s actually a really key point of history that it’s like, “Oh, do I get bogged down here?” I don’t know. There you go, we got to do a little bit, how about that? Is that okay?

**Brent:** I will say, maybe the only thing that I know about Seventh-Day Adventist is that at one point, I think when I was in high school, I was doing something in my non-denominational church and we were partnered with the Seventh-Day Adventist church, and I just thought that was really cool.

**Marty:** Yes, absolutely. Listen, there’s a ton of things that we have listeners to our podcast. Our commitment to Sabbath, really resonates with the Seventh-Day Adventist worldview. The way we value the Old Testament, very much resonates with the Seventh-Day Adventist worldview. I don’t care for the eschatology, the application of how we engage the law is a little tricky to me, but there’s a lot of things that resonate.

It’s not just a crazy group of people over there, they’re just people. They have convictions, just like all of us. Listen, people think Stone-Campbell Movement are crazy, [chuckles] and they’re not all that wrong. I don’t know if we know that inside the movement, but it’s true.

**Brent:** It’s important to remember, going all the way back to Genesis 1, that we all have the breath of God in us.

**Marty:** It’s a key distinction, same invitation: trust the story.

**Brent:** An immense amount of potential in all of this.

**Marty:** It’s so true, which is why those categories just don’t help. Is it a cult? Is it not a cult? Is it orthodox? Is it not orthodox? It’s just not helpful, because that’s not how the story works. Nevertheless, note that all these conversations, all these movements that we’ve been talking about here, all of them—Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Restoration Movement—all these movements are capitalizing, albeit unintentionally, on a newfound culture of freedom and independence, to start a new revived expression of a faith that they felt was corrupted and dying.

All these movements are capitalizing on this American experience, just bristling and pushing against this colonial denominationalism and they want something new and they want something free and they want something individual and they want something independent. All these movements are saying, “We have that for you. Come experience this new independent spiritual faith.”

**Brent:** It really is kind of a function of geography too, because if you’re in England and you don’t like what the Anglican Church is doing, where are you going to go? If you’re in America and you don’t like what whoever is doing, you just shift over to the west a little bit. There’s plenty of room.

**Marty:** Yes, absolutely. You got a village right down the road that is a totally different worldview. It’s kind of harder to get adopted into it, but you’re rubbing shoulders in much more of a diverse culture than you were previously.

Now, on the scientific front, things are not turning out well for Christendom, trying to hold on to the doctrinal confessions and cradle understanding of their faith. In the middle of the 19th century, Charles Darwin began his famous work, Karl Marx was pursuing new political ideals and both seemed to work against a Christian worldview. Many of these ideas were critiqued within the Christian worldview; some critical thinkers in Christianity were affirming certain components of those worldviews.

The need for social vigilance was championed by people like William Booth, a Methodist pastor, that’s what he was. He founded the Salvation Army. Booth would become one of the lead thinkers, shaping Christianity’s social consciousness toward the turn of the century, giving rise to what many people call the Social Gospel. While the term has a negative connotation in many conservative evangelical circles, like I was raised in, the movement was simply trying to recapture the practical and misplaced emphasis on caring for the poor. The marginalized in our increasingly industrialized world, where the gap between rich and poor was rapidly increasing—does that sound a little BEMA-esque to you, Brent?

**Brent:** A little bit.

**Marty:** It’s a little bit. A little bit of the margins, a little bit of the mumzer/mamzer, a little bit of the alien, the orphan, and the widow, and I sure hope that when we hear that we think, that is in many ways the Gospel. Is it the whole Gospel? We can talk about that one later, but there is a very much a social component to the Gospel from Genesis to Revelation. These were some of the same things that modernity and all of its social, political growth pains were trying to articulate as well, in the political realm.

The secular aspect of this cultural growth curve is known as secular humanism, and after we finish fighting World War I—it’s interesting how war always hinders progress. Shocker there. War always seems to get in the way, every time. Christendom in North America turned its attention to fighting those secular ideals. When we’re done fighting our wars, we started fighting those secular ideals. And like a lit powder keg, the famous Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, leads to the eruption of Christian fundamentalism. Christians immediately saw themselves in a culture war with secular humanism. The problem is that this rings incredibly reminiscent of—anything else we talked about recently, Brent?

**Brent:** Yes.

**Marty:** Like what?

**Brent:** Copernicus, perhaps. Galileo.

**Marty:** Yes, absolutely. Remember when they went from the geocentric to heliocentric and everybody thought they were crazy, and it turns out there were some things that we needed to learn. It seems that we may be in danger even today of misidentifying our enemy, and the truth that we should be fighting to preserve. With all the splintering and division of Christianity, it becomes harder and harder for us to learn from our mistakes. Is it all going to be hopeless? Well, we’ve got one more period of history to look at before we start to close up our time here.

**Brent:** This is that same question I had in the last episode or two episodes ago, where we were talking about how much influence did Catholic theologians from France have with everyone else when you have a hundred different movements or a thousand different movements of people, how much can anyone have any influence?

**Marty:** Now, that influence is definitely starting to wane and it has just become something else. Those early days, those things were more connected, and then as this thing keeps just splintering and drifting apart, that conversation just becomes its own conversation and loses that same next-door neighbor influence it used to have.

**Brent:** Every group has to make their own set of mistakes and learn from them, independently.

**Marty:** Absolutely.

**Brent:** It’s maybe a little bit more of a mess, right?

**Marty:** Yes, you’re right.

**Brent:** Well, if you have any questions about the show, you can go to bemadiscipleship.com and get in touch with us there. Thanks for joining us in the BEMA Podcast, we’ll talk to you again soon.
