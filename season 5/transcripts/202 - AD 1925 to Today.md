AD 1925 to Today

**Brent Billings:** This is the BEMA podcast with Marty Solomon, I’m his co-host, Brent Billings. Today we bring the story to our current day, seeing what this last century has done to the world of faith that we call our own. What is Christian fundamentalism, and where did it come from, and how does evangelicalism fit into all of this? As believers, we make many assumptions about the world around us, but knowing why it exists is often helpful in accepting what it is.

**Marty Solomon:** Love it, man.

**Brent:** It’s like the whole episode right there.

**Marty:** I know, we may have capped off this whole journey with the best intro ever. That’s great, love that, well played, Brent Billings. Let’s see here, where are we at? 1925, or thereabouts, fundamentalism and secular humanism were locked in a fierce battle for truth for a decade. It would be worth answering the question that often goes unanswered in these conversations that we often have about this last century. What happened to the parts of Christendom that wouldn’t have aligned with fundamentalism?

A lot of us grew up in fundamentalism, that’s our reference point—what about everything else? At this point in history, those who would have rejected fundamentalism often drifted towards theological liberalism. While the church in this century would eventually learn how to have a more progressive conversation and put more options, if you will, on the table, rather than a simple bifurcated presentation of the argument of Conservative and Liberal.

This is not that point in history yet, we’re not at that point yet. At this point in history, you really have a world trying to navigate. You have academia, you have the world of textual criticism, you have people learning to ask questions of the scripture. Really, it is a world that a lot of the journey that we’ve had here at BEMA; it’s grounded in a world of critical thought and textual criticism. Yet, I know me personally, I’m rooted in a Christian fundamentalism. My Christian fundamentalist parents taught me, my churches that I grew up in taught me to, above all else, love Jesus and the Bible; and for that, I’m deeply grateful, I’m deeply indebted to them.

Now, I’ve asked a whole lot of critical questions and deconstructed a lot of everything else about my fundamentalism, but their appreciation for Jesus, the person of Jesus, and the place of Scripture, is deeply ingrained in who I am. BEMA is, 100 years later, a bringing back of these two worlds, where these two worlds took two separate paths for a while to navigate some of these nuances. Then what we’ll find out later in this episode, somewhere towards the end of that century, those two worlds began to come back together and collide again. BEMA’s the result of that collision. Which camp do we fit into?

We don’t—at least I personally, have a little bit of both—but back in 1925, we didn’t have both. We had a splitting of these two worldviews. For much of theological liberalism, their position felt like a weak take on humanism with Jesus slapped on the label. The two options that most 20th-century Christians had to choose from, seem today like equally bad options, which is interesting to us. Either one of the camps today seems like, oh, why are those my two options, because we’ve navigated some of those over the last 100 years.

It also looked like Christianity, while putting up a good fight, was not going to have the staying power to outlast the run that humanism was putting together. Humanism was, I reckon, at quite the lead in this great game of life. That all ended with the arrival of World War II, that famous World War. Any hope that humanity could usher in some type of utopian societal existence—whether it was by fascist, socialist, communist, or even democratic means—would come to a crashing end. Every humanistic worldview seemed to show its true self in the face of unbelievable genocide, communist oppression, and nuclear war.

Simply put, humanity isn’t as great as we thought it was. This gave Christianity a great and sudden turnaround that ushered in what I call the modern evangelistic era and the eventual rise of the Evangelical Church. Fundamentalism gives way to a broader, softer version of itself and a wider presentation of Protestant American Christianity. While the beliefs that justify evangelical orthodoxy changed depending on who you asked—even today, right now as we record this, modern evangelicalism attempted to plant its flag and set up its defenses. It’s worth noting that we still find ourselves in this tension today. The culture wars—ever heard of the culture wars, Brent Billings? Culture wars, what?

**Brent:** I’ve lived in them. I’ve boycotted things.

**Marty:** How dare they take Merry Christmas off my coffee cup? The culture wars of the current evangelical church are not the great promised land of our day, nor are they the last and final Armageddon that we often want them to be. At best, they are simply the awkward phases of a modern evangelicalism that is going through a sociological puberty, if you will. At their worst, they are the final gasping breaths of a movement coming to a very unflattering end. We would do well to consider these things.

The modern evangelical movement was created by some of the greatest evangelists of our era, people like Billy Graham, and Bill Bright was the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ, now known as Cru, in our world of campus ministry. People like Billy Graham and Bill Bright, they helped the church navigate this very difficult era giving the church a language for communicating the Gospel like we had never seen. I believe history might look back on this era with a similar perspective to our view of the printing press or the Reformation. This modern evangelical push paved the way for cultural engagement like we had never seen before.

Evangelism was now in the hands of normal, everyday parishioners, not just the clergy, not just preachers, wasn’t just happening in revival tents, the creation of the four spiritual laws, no matter you or I might feel about their theological accuracy. That’s all I’m going to say about that. Brent can be proud of me, but those four spiritual laws created a world where college students, co-workers, and soccer moms could articulate the movement of Jesus in simple language.

The same resurgence of cultural engagement would eventually lead to what many from the 1970s call the Jesus movement and the great testimonies of the movement of Jesus in people’s hearts. That was where there was this huge crashing movement of people that were, “I’m welcoming Jesus into my heart, Jesus the Christ is living inside of me.” There was a newfound fervor in our modern era, for the movement of Jesus.

**Brent:** My mom got saved in 1975.

**Marty:** A child of the Jesus Movement; has she ever talked about the Jesus Movement?

**Brent:** Oh, yes!

**Marty:** She knows all about that, absolutely—and so many of our parents’ generation experienced that. What a beautiful time in our last century’s history.

About the same time in the 1970s as this whole Jesus movement was taking place in the—what do we call it—the average person’s world. The world of Christian fundamentalism and evangelicalism, you also have the world of academia, which we don’t want to forget about, that other stream of consciousness. That textual criticism, they’re going through their own little new frontier, if you will.

I’m going to oversimplify this print of history just to try to communicate it very cleanly and crisply and not get lost in the weeds or mired in detail. This is going to be highly oversimplified, I want to give that disclaimer. The work of Jacob Neusner—Jacob Neusner, we’ve quoted him before right, Brent?

**Brent:** I believe so, we’ve at least referenced him.

**Marty:** Man, he’s quite the figure, we even had an article the other day that we were looking at, maybe we could even link, or Wikipedia page, or his list of 950 books that he wrote in his lifetime.

**Brent:** Wrote and edited. I’m not exactly sure what the details of that mean, but whatever your role is, if you’re involved in 950 books, it’s pretty substantial.

**Marty:** That is something else. Jacob Neusner, we might have some show notes that you could look out for him there in this episode. He changed the world of hermeneutics as we know it. BEMA is not just indebted—this whole discussion would not happen without the work of Jacob Neusner, period. Neusner, who was a Jewish literary scholar, not a Christian—please don’t hear me say he was a believer, he was not—just an academic Jew with Orthodox roots. He was attempting to understand how modern Christian thought had influenced Jewish thought.

As he brought modern Christian scholars—mostly at that era, most of them were Catholic scholars—to the table, they found themselves learning lessons from Judaism. These Catholic scholars found themselves learning lessons from Judaism that had gone missing some 1800 years ago. Realizing the impact that’s had on our understanding of the Bible, academic Christians would never again engage in scholastic research or archeology, without the aid of their Jewish brothers.

**Brent:** Was this before or after Vatican II?

**Marty:** Oh, man, I’m not good with Catholic history, so how about we dig up the dates on that one? Go ahead and tell me.

**Brent:** That was between 1962 and 1965.

**Marty:** Yes. Most of this work is going to happen after that. I don’t know how much we talked about it, Brent. Let me go all the way back to the beginning of Session 5. We talked about this Gentile movement, kicking the Jews out, and trying to repair it, but never really repairing it. It’s worth noting here, we never repaired that schism for 1800 years. We went down our own stream of thought, our own stream of consciousness. We had councils and reformations, and great movements throughout history, but they were all very Gentile. Now, 1800 years later, these two worlds collide again, this Jewish and Gentile world, on a scholastic level, on an academic level in the world of scholarship.

All of a sudden we discover things that—people look at this discussion and they say, “That’s crazy, nobody was asking these questions for 1800 years?” Sometimes, the answer to that question is, “Nope.” People weren’t asking these questions for 1800 years. We didn’t realize that there were questions to ask, so just a massive point in history for me or from my personal perspective.

**Brent:** Well, I don’t really know that much about Vatican II, or why it came about, or what was happening in the Catholic Church at the time, I don’t know any of that history, but I do know that it changed a significant amount of things in the Catholic world.

**Marty:** Yes, sure.

**Brent:** I’m just wondering, if they had a new council today, in light of all of this interaction with Judaism, how much would happen?

**Marty:** That’s a great question. I’ve never even thought about how that part of the Catholic trajectory—and because it was Catholic scholarship, so present at the table—I never even thought about how that was impacting—I just never thought about how those paths crossed. It’s very interesting. A very good point.

Many people have asked me, how could we have not known this stuff for all those centuries? The ridiculously simplistic answer is that we just hadn’t asked. Until the work of Neusner and others, Christendom had been too worried about doctrinal purity, and theological rightness to ask basic questions about the Bible’s long-lost Jewish context.

Since the turn of the century, many evangelical churches are beginning to experience the work of these scholars, finally turning the corner to our common knowledge. Think about guys like N. T. Wright, the way he’s changed theology? He just stands on the shoulders of a conversation that started just right in front of him, bringing a whole new set of questions to scholarship, that’s where N. T. Wright and the entire Kingdom theology movement that comes after him, and it’s not just him, it’s with him. You get the idea?

I had professors who told me in college that new discoveries often take 20 to 30 years to find a presence in the church. These new discoveries have to be vetted, and then handed to the educational institutions, which by that I mean universities or seminaries, and then taught to the eventual pastors who would teach these things from pulpits —and through podcasts or blog posts, if you will.

Now with the rise of the Internet, the distribution of this information and all information, good and bad, by the way, is increasing exponentially. That curve is shortening, it’s speeding up but for much of the century, it would take 30 years for us to discover something in scholarship. That discovery, talk about it, make sure it’s academically viable, then hand it to our seminaries, which then have to hand it to preachers, who then have to go out and get jobs, who then have to rise in those jobs to get in pulpits.

It takes 30–40 years, or 20 years at least, just to see this information land in our congregations. It’s crazy how long that—and now the Internet’s changing all that, more on that here in a moment.

**Brent:** Everything has been—from 1925 on, we’ve got the Dead Sea Scrolls, we’ve got Jacob Neusner—things are changing so fast now.

**Marty:** Absolutely. That’s just a part of the world that we live in right now. That’s not the only thing that changed at the turn of the century, the world of science had also taken an unexpected turn. While the modern era produced a scientific belief that we would be able to figure out everything if given enough time to see how this fits in that world of secular humanism. Fits so nicely in there just from a scientific perspective, but we don’t live in that world anymore, post World War II.

The discovery of quantum science radically changed all of that. I will not be speaking about quantum science. I am not an expert in that. Some of the most basic principles of physics and Newtonian movement—you remember Newton? We talked about how great Newton was a few episodes ago, Sir Isaac Newton? All those things we knew about physics, all the things that Newton taught us no longer applied in quantum science. The scientific world reeled in the implication of this development in scientific discovery.

Combine this with the sociological realizations of this century, we have a major shift in worldview. While humanism took a major hit, secularism was and is today, far from dead. In fact, since the days of the French Revolution, this might be the most shocking shift Christendom has yet to accept. We’re still in denial about this. While we talk about it often, we talk about the post-Christian culture in some circles, we have not figured out how to respond well to it.

Into this mess, Brent, enters postmodernity, the postmodern conversation. In the late 1990s, the cultural cry became, “What do we truly know anyway?” Whether it was society, or politics, or science, it seemed like absolutes weren’t as absolute, as we once thought. While the church cried out against what we perceived as moral relativism, the world moved on anyway.

Some progressive evangelicals attempted to move with this cultural change, bringing the Gospel back into the cultural conversation by creating what was known as the Emerging Church. Remember, the whole Emerging Church phase, Brent? Were you around before that?

**Brent:** I heard about it a lot. I never really understood what it meant.

**Marty:** You’re on the back end of that curve, so that was never really—boy that was—when I was going into Bible college, postmodernity was all the rage. And by “rage,” I mean evangelicalism was in a rage against postmodernity. The Emerging Church was the den of iniquity and the spawn of Satan himself. Largely rejected by Evangelicalism, and I would argue no longer considered a viable approach, it’s just morphed; it’s evolved into something new. This new day of Christian thought is no longer about the Emerging Church, at least in its original form. The Emerging Church helped start conversations that would set the stage for growth that the church needed to prepare for in its survival in this coming world.

A decade or two later, we find ourselves at Today. If you look at your timeline, find Today, that’s where we’re at. With the rise of decentralized consumerism, think of things like Uber, Airbnb, with the rise of social networking, it’s changed the landscape of our interaction, pretty much everywhere. It’s hard to know exactly what lies just around the bend.

Where is God calling us, and what does any of this mean? Is there any hope at all for the future of Christianity? It seems like we have devolved into such a mess, that it’s hard to know what God would even approve of in our efforts. In fact, fear not listeners of BEMA. I believe we find ourselves—as every generation has—perfectly placed for this future and that’s where we’ll turn our attention in our next episode.

**Brent:** You mentioned a timeline that I don’t believe we mentioned at the top of the episode.

**Marty:** That’s correct.

**Brent:** If you haven’t looked at it yet, there is a presentation for this episode with a timeline of this last century.

**Marty:** A lot of stuff in that one too, a lot of goodies that we’ll be more familiar with because it’s our day and age.

**Brent:** Alright, that does it for this episode. If you have any questions about the show, you can go to bemadiscipleship.com and get in touch with us there. We would love to hear more about what your journey has been, what your background is, and where you’ve come from and maybe you have some things to bring to this conversation that we don’t have any experience in.

Get in touch, let us know what that is, and thanks for joining us on the BEMA podcast. We’ll talk to you again soon.
