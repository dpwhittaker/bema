AD 100–300

**Brent Billings:** This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon. I’m his co-host Brent Billings. Today we walk through the second and third centuries of church history. Why are we so not-Jewish in our Christian practice today? What happened to cause such a schism between Jews and Christians?

**Marty Solomon:** First of all, our first real episode of getting into the meat of our Session 5 here and probably good just to—hopefully everybody listened to our last episode. I would imagine everybody did, but just some disclaimers that we gave there.

This is a session on church history, but our goal here is, again, not actually the church history. I’m not going to dive deep into church history. I’m not an expert in church history. I don’t care about church history in the same way. What I care about personally and what I think we care about here at BEMA is the Bible. I care about the Bible, I care about what the narrative of God looks like, and what he’s been calling us to do. Why is church history relevant? Because I want to understand what happened to the Bible. What happened to us? What happened to us and the way we related to the Bible? Because I care about the Bible.

Again, if you’re really into church history, you’ll be frustrated throughout the session. That’s okay. There are lots of other great podcasts out there, I’m sure, that dive into that. We’re stepping way back. We’re taking a 10,000-foot perspective. I will not be diving into the nuances. When I get to your pet period of history or your favorite topic or subject, you will often be like, “Go into more detail,” or “It’s far more complex or nuanced than that.” That’s certainly all true.

I’m making some sweeping observations, and trying to take a huge sweeping look at what has happened throughout history.

Quite frankly, Brent, you’ve been listening to some podcasts. You’ve been reading the same texts that I used when I was in college. You may actually be more studied up on this stuff than I am. You might hear Brent Billings actually chime in here and correct me and give some thoughts on church history as we go through. It might be fun.

**Brent:** We’ll see about that. I do have a question, though.

**Marty:** Sure.

**Brent:** As I was reading that intro, we talked about a schism and the Great Schism, capital G, capital S. I think, typically, it refers to the schism between the Western and Eastern Christian Church much later. I don’t know if we’re going to talk about that probably, but maybe, you would consider the Christian-Jewish schism a greater schism?

**Marty:** The greater schism?

**Brent:** Yes, sure. I don’t know. I’ve never even thought about that.

**Marty:** Actually, church history will just add more fuel to an already confusing fire, because church history is really convoluted when it comes to the schisms and what they used to refer to them as. There’s the Great Schism, there’s the East-West Schism. The East-West Schism is typically referring to a later schism, like the East-West of the Western world, so it’s even more confusing. There’s already some schisms that are talked about. We’ll talk about all of them as we go through this session, but, at least, the big ones, but yes, this one is in my mind. I don’t know if I’d say the most important, but as far as where my reference point is coming from, certainly the most important, this schism here.

**Brent:** It’s a substantial moment in history, at the very least.

**Marty:** Without a doubt.

**Brent:** Maybe I would say the reason I might not end up piping in that much is that church history—and history in general—is just so vast and there’s so much to know about it and we don’t really want to make a three-hour podcast episode.

**Marty:** Yes, you either kind of dive all the way in or you just take a wider look or take an option B.

**Brent:** Yes, for sure.

**Marty:** We do have some presentations, so you can pull that up. It won’t be a whole bunch of slides, but some timelines that Brent has created for us to help us. Some disclaimers on those. Brent’s going to do better than I did back in the past, but these aren’t meant to be perfectly to scale. The points of the timeline are not necessarily perfectly positioned at just the right year, these are meant to step back and be a visual aid for understanding the larger conversation. These aren’t perfect timelines. That’s not what they’re designed as. They’re just visual aids to help us understand how the flow of history worked. Anything you would add to that, Brent?

**Brent:** No.

**Marty:** Excellent.

**Brent:** I look forward to revealing them to the listeners, though.

**Marty:** Excellent. With no further to do, here we go. We left off with that repeated question: What happened? Many students ask me this question. Not just in reference to the history of Christendom, but in reference to our Judaic roots. We come from an incredibly Jewish story, following a Jewish rabbi and his Jewish talmidim. How did we become so separated from our Jewish foundation? There are many in scholarship who weigh in on these big questions. They have their opinions.

From a historically respectable perspective, I have found two opinions on this, that I find plausible based on what we know today and what I understand. One of those two plausible opinions, I hold personally. Let’s start with the one I don’t hold personally. The first opinion is based on an understanding of a much more defined schism between Jewish and Gentile church. By that, what do we mean there? What two characters did we speak of in Session 4, Brent?

**Brent:** Paul and James.

**Marty:** Yes, this Jerusalem church of James pushing against this Pauline expansion into the world of Asia and Asia Minor—a very Gentile world.

**Brent:** Why Paul instead of John in this case?

**Marty:** John, I think, would maybe represent that later, but John becomes pastor to Asia much later in history, maybe after this is so relevant and what feels like the tension. I’m going to say the tension we see in the book of Acts, it’s a Jerusalem council is between Paul and James. Then New Testament scholars that are of a more liberal progressive stance are definitely going to say James and Paul were completely different churches. They’re just different churches. You can see that when you read the New Testament. I disagree, but that’s their perspective.

**Brent:** Okay.

**Marty:** Definitely, Paul and James. We referenced that before, we discussed it before back in Session 4, book of Acts throughout. Like I said, when we had those past discussions, I don’t want to miss the undeniable tension between the church in Jerusalem and the church in Asia, at the Jerusalem Council. There’s definitely a tension in the book of Acts; it’s undeniable. I also hold to that same record in the book of Acts and believe that the apostolic leaders were able to come to an agreement and a mutual understanding led by the Holy Spirit. What did we call that process, Brent?

**Brent:** Binding and loosing.

**Marty:** Binding and loosing. Talked about that in Session 4. A process that I have heard about for many decades and only recently feel like I have a grasp on it.

**Brent:** Yes. Absolutely.

**Marty:** That’s what my understanding was, but this opinion from this school of scholarship, believes that this Christian movement, which began in Jewish rank and order, was much more bent on the proclamation of their subversive Gospel. This created unwanted—especially in Asia—unwanted political tension. If you remember, Brent, we talked about the Jewish Exception, which was good for the Jew because it meant they Jew didn’t have to worship the emperor, but in that same Jewish Exception, part of the deal was that it outlawed aggressive proselytization. They couldn’t go out and evangelize the Jewish movement. They got some political breaks, but they weren’t allowed to go out and heavily recruit to their brotherhood.

This new Jesus movement doesn’t operate that way. They’re heavily bent on invitation into this new world, this new reality, there’s a new King and new Kingdom, and this new Kingdom is challenging just saying there’s a new King and a new Kingdom, is challenging that status quo and upsetting the empire. This portion of Roman history was the height of Pax Romana.

**Brent:** Absolutely.

**Marty:** The world was Rome at this point.

**Brent:** Absolutely.

**Marty:** This theory proposes that the Jewish religion jettisons its Jesus following believers who are mostly Gentile in nature. This Jesus movement within Judaism is causing all these problems because they’re aggressive in their euangelion, and so Judaism says, you’re going to get us in trouble, get out of here. That’s one plausible explanation. There are certainly pieces in history to support that theory. I don’t think that’s actually what we see happening, personally, and I’ve tried to make that clear throughout Session 4.

Especially in light of recent scholarship—there’s the late David Flusser who was one of my teacher’s teachers. Ray was taught by a lot of people, one of them Dave Flusser—he actually lived next door to Dr. Flusser for a time. He suggested decades ago that early Christianity was predominantly a Jewish movement. Now, Flusser is a Jewish scholar, not a follower of Jesus, not a believer in Jesus. He said that Christianity was predominantly a Jewish movement that didn’t see such internal tensions until much later. It was not a popular opinion—not in Judaism, not in Christian scholarship—just not a popular opinion.

One of the largest criticisms of his theory was the lack of evidence that Jews and Gentiles ever worshiped together. We just haven’t found any evidence that Jew and Gentile would ever worship together. However, in the last 20 years, as archaeological efforts have increased, especially in modern Turkey, the world of Asia and Asia Minor, we are finding more and more evidence to suggest that Flusser was correct. You actually got to see some of these things when you went to Turkey, yes, Brent?

**Brent:** Yes.

**Marty:** I won’t even show pictures because they’re that cool, but we found some pretty cool archaeological finds that showed that Jew and Christian—I shouldn’t say it that way—that Jew and Gentile were worshiping together within the same fellowship and the same body.

**Brent:** We also won’t show them because they’re oftentimes very difficult to see.

**Marty:** Yes, absolutely.

**Brent:** Especially in the two-dimensional image, you need to be able to be there and look around. “Oh, okay, I see it, but yes, it’s there.”

**Marty:** Absolutely. Come join us in Turkey. That’s one opinion.

[music]

Instead, I cling to a different theory. I cling to a theory that the schism happened later, not with Paul and James, but later, just after the turn of the century, when Trajan and Hadrian, two different Roman emperors, they led some of the most aggressive, maybe not the most brutal, but definitely some of the most aggressive persecutions of the Jews. The Jews, mind you, not to the Christians, but the Jews. Historians have long wondered why the largest of those persecutions seem to have such a Jewish focus.

The Jews weren’t the largest Imperial threat to Roman power. It would seem that the Christians were. Many have suggested, and in my opinion rightly so, that the Christians were, in fact, so Jewish at that point, that they were seen as an indistinguishable part of Judaism. They were so Jewish that the Romans just looked and went, “That’s a Jewish movement,” even though they had Gentiles in it.

**Brent:** This a problem for Rome, because they require not only worship and sacrifices to the Emperor, but taxes. Then the Jews are exempt from this stuff with the Jewish exception. If this Christian Judaism is sweeping through the Empire and all of a sudden they’re losing a whole bunch of their tax revenue, this is a problem for them, right?

**Marty:** Absolutely. They weren’t exempt from all Roman taxes, they were exempt from some because of the temple tax and they had some agreements at different points in history. Even outside the taxes and the financial relationship, this whole system runs on a certain level of Imperial commitment, patriotism, fear, its empire, just like we talked about way back in Session 1. There’s this definite, they need people to be bought into the Roman agenda. When somebody comes in with a new Gospel, a new euangelion, this is a major, major problem for Rome. Not something they would just ignore.

From the little pieces of history we do have, and though most of Judaism originally stood behind their Gentile converts, most Judaism, when the Gentiles were coming in, in my opinion, most Judaism stood behind their Gentile converts and the theosabes, if you remember the theosabes, what that mean, Brent?

**Brent:** God-fearing Gentiles.

**Marty:** God-fearers, right? Most Jews are behind them. We did hear about some exceptions when we studied Revelation.

**Brent:** Behind, as in support, not stand as in—behind us and hide?

**Marty:** Absolutely. They were there to embrace them into the family, when Rome came knocking on their door and the Jews said, “No, no, no, they’re a part of this Jewish family. You can’t touch them.” They supported them.

We did hear about some that didn’t, when we studied about the Book of Revelation. We heard about the synagogue of Satan. I’m of the school of thought that believes that that was a group of Jews that actually did the exact opposite, that when Rome came by, they said, “Hey, these people aren’t Jewish, they’re Gentiles. Get them out of here.” That would be the exception to the general historical rule, it would seem. These same Gentiles seem to turn their backs on their Jewish brothers and sisters when Rome came looking to extinguish Judaism.

Notice how that distinction between, “We’re here to kill the Christians,” or, “We’re here to kill the Jews from Rome.” That distinction changes everything because the Gentiles choose to fall back on their uncircumcised roots. They essentially say, “Are you here for the Jews? Well, we’re not Jewish and we’ve got the foreskin to prove it. We’re Gentiles.” They left their Jewish counterparts, left them out to dry, created a schism that we have never, in the Jewish-Gentile world, I don’t think we’ve ever healed. We’ve actually exacerbated it—but that’s for the rest of Session 5, we’ll talk about it.

Following the Hadrianic persecution, and the Bar Kochba revolt, this helps explain why the writings of the early church are so anti-Semitic in their teachings. Just one or two generations removed from the apostles, Brent, they’re already super anti-Semitic. Like Irenaeus is one of the earliest, most respected church fathers. Irenaeus, somewhere late second century, is a disciple of the disciples, and he’s already anti-Semitic in his writings. Very, very vehemently against the Jews and all kinds of people, by the way. Irenaeus is great, has a lot of wonderful things to contribute to church history—but was horribly exclusive, enough with that. We’ll insert that bit because I just made every church history major, very, very frustrated by that comment, but nevertheless, just my personal opinion.

The schism, maybe we should put a link in there. We talked about the Bar Kochba revolt. Probably some people that don’t know what that is. Brent, maybe you can do a Wikipedia link for the Bar Kochba revolt, so people can put that in their context of history. This schism, this Jewish-Gentile schism, will have more than relational implications. Now that the Jews are gone, this Jesus-following body—listen—has lost their connection to the what, Brent?

**Brent:** To the Text.

**Marty:** They’ve lost their connection to the Text. They no longer have walking libraries of Torah, and the Jewish narrative to teach and lead them. We talked about this with Romans. What would it be to have all the Jews leave, and now you got to figure out how to do this thing as Gentiles?

**Brent:** We’re a good millennium away from the printing press at this point.

**Marty:** Absolutely. You don’t just get to look it up. There’s no BibleGateway.com, there’s no Bible app. It’s all supposed to be in your head. The moment that this anchor, this Jewish anchor was pulled up, Gentiles were left to lean on the only thing that they knew intimately. Unfortunately, the worldview that dominated the Hellenistic culture was Gnosticism. You may want to review, maybe, our discussion on the book of Colossians, we talked about Gnosticism. Now, like I mentioned, a few episodes ago, I have recently discovered that we are learning a lot about Gnosticism. Even things that scholars have taught very recently, people like N.T. Wright.

We’re discovering, maybe there’s more to the conversation. We’ve talked about this before, we’re always going to be learning new things. We’re always going to do the best with what we have on the table and then 400 years from now, we’re going to know things that we didn’t know before and you’re going to look back, and we’re going to think, “Oh, man, how stupid were we?” But we only can do the best that we can do with what we have. We’re learning more and more about Gnosticism.

I’m going to try not to make too big of a deal about this because I don’t want to overstate some things, that maybe we’ll find out were different, but Gnosticism is definitely running rampant. There are definitely some negative attributes to Gnosticism. Maybe we’ve overplayed some of those things, but the dualistic nature of Gnosticism. Maybe we shouldn’t call it Gnosticism, maybe we should just refer to the dualism, the separation of spirit and soil, of body and spirit. The separation of all things spiritual are good, all things physical are bad. This Docetism, this dualism, this is running rampant and that’s the second language of the Gentile.

If you lose Torah, and you have to think about and talk about God, you’re going to do it in ways that you’re familiar with because you’ve just lost the Torah and the Jewish narrative that used to be your identity. This conflicting worldview led to all corrupted teachings and beliefs. We can even assume that we have the presence of the New Testament writings, we can assume that we have things like the Didache—we’re going to put another link in the show notes about the Didache, which is a piece of early church writing. It’s essentially the early church’s manual for passing on the apostles’ teaching to new converts.

We even have some pieces of writing and yet, even in spite of all that, almost immediately, there were arguments for the rejections of different writings. A man by the name of Marcion was arguing for the rejection of the Tanakh and most of the Gospels. He did have a full acceptance of the letters from Paul, most of the Gospel of Luke, and maybe a few other letters that we have in our New Testament, but he rejected Tanakh. He rejected Matthew, Mark, John—almost entirely—and accepted Paul and Luke.

Now if that sounds familiar, it’s because much of evangelical Christianity continues to approach the New Testament in the same way. What is it that we focus on? Who have we pointed out before, Brent, when we read the New Testament? What writings do we gravitate towards?

**Brent:** We absolutely gravitate towards Paul.

**Marty:** Oh, we just love Paul. Jesus is kind of hard to understand, but Paul we love. That’s just part of the book. Everybody that comes up to us at BEMA, they always have to tell us, “Oh man, you’ve just made the whole”—what part of the Bible?—“come alive.” Give it to me.

**Brent:** The Old Testament?

**Marty:** The Old Testament, because we don’t talk about the Old Testament. It’s interesting, Marcion was eventually declared a heretic and his arguments were completely rejected by Christianity, but it’s interesting today, that we actually still have a very Marcion-like view and approach to the Scripture and to theology. And I don’t know if that goes all the way back and is tied directly to Marcion or is just a really horrible coincidence, but we—it’s so funny that we talk about how Marcion was a heretic and yet we really approach the Bible in many of the same ways. Rejecting the Old Testament, maybe having a pet Gospel, but just really elevating the teachings of Paul. That was heresy for the early Christians.

This whole interaction with Marcion and his arguments as heresy, brought up the need for this Gentile movement to declare which teachings would be authoritative, which books belong in the Bible. The movement, this Christian movement was able to move forward from that. From there, we received what’s known as the Muratorian Canon. It was actually a long process, it didn’t just show up after that conversation, but through the processes that followed, we ended up with the Muratorian Canon, which is basically, what is your New Testament, your Bible is based on the—this canon had only 22 of the 27 letters in it, and the larger conversation surrounding it would later lead to the reordering of the Hebrew scriptures, that we’ve talked about before back in Session 1 and 2, for Christians.

It had an undeniable anti-Semetic bent to it. Eventually this Muratorian Canon would grow, they would add some of those extra books, that it didn’t have to begin with, but that Muratorian Canon is really the Bible. It’s the basis of the Bible that you and I use today.

This unfortunate new world where Jew and Gentile were split apart, this schism, would have brought other issues to the table. Had the Gentile Christian movement not been at odds with the empire of Rome, it probably would have spun out of control even quicker, Brent, if it hadn’t been that they were running for their lives. They were simply trying to survive at this point. Rome is out to extinguish the Christian movement.

It keeps what could have even spun even further out of control, it keeps that spiraling out of control, at bay. As they continued to deal with the persecution that came and left and came and left, they were forced to bind together and cling to the essentials for the survival of their faith. It’s a dark shame that we weren’t able to do this with the company and the leadership provided by our Jewish brothers and sisters. We will be left to wonder what could have been.

With the age to come, olam haba—remember in our last episode, Brent, I suggested that Jesus was going to come back, his return was imminent, and God was waiting for us to speed up the coming of Christ—and then I said something happened. This is that something that I believe happened. I do believe Jesus was, maybe, on the doorstep, “Is it time, Dad? Is it time? Is it time for me to come back? Is it time?” Then this thing spun out of control. If we would have not separated from our Jewish roots, would the age to come have arrived and Jesus’s return been realized just as the writers of the New Testament were claiming? Maybe so.

For now, they run for their lives—these early Christians. They stand and they die, but it’s all about to change, and that is what will send us into the next episode, Brent.

**Brent:** We’ve just covered AD 100–300.

**Marty:** Yes, absolutely.

**Brent:** All about what we talked about was in the earlier part of that period.

**Marty:** Yes, early second century. In the, I don’t know, 114–117 and the years that followed right after that, that’s going to be 120. That window there of 114–120, that’s where the Trajan, Hadrian, persecution, all that stuff, rolls out. The world is changing and Jew and Gentile get torn apart.

**Brent:** We don’t really have much on our chart for the third century, but you can be sure that it was a tough time.

**Marty:** Yes, up and down. It’s just like Republicans and Democrats and the way that we go back and forth in our own culture. You’d have an emperor that would come to power and say, “I’m going to destroy this group of people,” in the same way that some of our political discourse talks about immigrants or outsiders or Muslims. We have these discourses that just, “Those people, that’s the problem,” and then you have some people that come and they’re—the Roman Empire did the same thing. “We’re going to embrace this, we’re going to accept this, we’re going to move forward together.” Some emperors would say, “No, we’re going to crush this, we’re going to destroy this, we’re going to exterminate this,” and that third century was just constant ups and downs of, “Okay, we can breathe… okay we need to run.”

**Brent:** Then in a general macro-sense, the Roman Empire in the third century was struggling, so those persecutions were a way for them to deal with their problems.

**Marty:** Absolutely yes. It was absolutely a scapegoat—a scapegoat to what’s going wrong and it became easy to point the finger. Luckily we don’t do that today [sarcasm], it’s wonderful. We’ve evolved so far from those kinds of silly, petty scapegoating techniques. [more sarcasm]

**Brent:** Perfect. We will pick up in the next episode starting with AD 300, so thanks for joining us on the BEMA Podcast. We’ll talk to you again soon.
