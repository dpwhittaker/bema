## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Second Great Awakening
As culture moved away from Christianity, there was a positive effect: Protestant believers fell into what's called the **Second Great Awakening**.

**Context**:
- **First Great Awakening**: Usually attributed to rise of Methodism (John Wesley, mid-1700s)
- **Second Great Awakening**: Great time of revival throughout North America and Europe

**Camp Meetings**:
- Where this awakening took place
- Brent had been to a camp meeting recently (Baptist church)
- Became times for denominations to come together for:
  - Fellowship
  - Worship
  - Preaching
- Focus on true confession and true repentance
- Led to great times of spiritual revival and movement

**Rise of Pentecostalism**:
Many attribute the rise of Pentecostalism to these experiences:
- Holy Spirit seemed poured out in abundance
- Widely accepted spiritual experiences
- After all the talk of science, mathematics, academics, systems - "where's the art? Where's the beauty? Where's the Holy Spirit?"
- These camp meetings led to movement of the Holy Spirit

**First Camp Meeting**: Widely accepted as 1801 in Kentucky (though probably not actually the first).

### American Colonial Denominationalism
Christianity had to jettison denominationalism because:
- Many denominations held onto "imperial moorings" through creeds and belief statements
- Think "more colonial version of church membership"
- Westminster Confession: "You will affirm this creed and this confession in order to be a part of the tribe here"

**Immigration Pattern**:
- If you migrated from Germany, you came with other Germans
- That group was probably Lutheran (if Protestant)
- When you set up your colony, it was German Lutheran
- Same with Scottish Presbyterians, Dutch Reformed, etc.
- Geographic/national/colonial identities based on where you came from

**The Clash**:
- You brought European church culture with you
- But you were building something brand new in America: freedom and independence
- Old systems clashed with new American culture of freedom
- Like "trying to plant some kind of plant that wasn't going to grow in that climate"

### The Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement

**Important Context**: This is Marty's background. He was:
- Raised in Reformed (Dutch Reformed - RCA) movement
- But **trained and pastored** in Restoration Movement (Christian Church, Church of Christ)
- This is his area of expertise for this session

**The Story of Barton Stone**:
- Recently ordained Presbyterian minister
- Asked to sign Westminster Confession before receiving Eucharist
- Appalled by use of confession and doctrine this way
- Thought: "No, we shouldn't have to sign document before we can receive bread and juice"
- Joined others with similar encounters
- Wanted to restore faith experienced in revivals
- Faith they associated with early church in Acts

**Thomas and Alexander Campbell**:
- Similar experience happening separately
- Thomas Campbell in America, Alexander in Europe (later came over)
- Very similar experiences on both sides of Atlantic
- Afraid to even talk about it at first
- Eventually these groups united

**The Beauty of Unity**:
- As Christianity was splintering everywhere
- This movement **drew people together** (at least initially)
- Stone and Campbell united different streams
- Lost that beauty after a few decades
- But at origins, it was drawing people together across denominational lines

**Marty's Honest Assessment**:
> "I often hate its application, but I love its ideals that it stood for. We have a lot of things wrong in the application of our movement, but nevertheless... I don't say that to offend anybody but to make it clear that I'm not taking some side."

**To BEMA Listeners**:
- Largest listenership by far lands in Restoration Movement
- Marty would love to do more on this history (maybe Session 6)
- But needs to balance for all listeners

### Other Movements of This Era
Driven by same disgust with direction of Christianity, several movements started:

**Joseph Smith and Mormonism** (LDS - Latter-Day Saints):
- Marty's whole family (dad's side) is committed LDS/Mormon
- He tries to be generous and hospitable
- Sees "very, very key distinctions between what I'm going to call orthodoxy and... the LDS movement"
- But tries to avoid unhelpful categories and labels

**Charles Russell and Jehovah's Witnesses**:
- Key distinctions from orthodox Christianity
- But Marty resists lumping movements together

**Ellen G. White and Seventh-Day Adventist**:
- Connected with John Darby
- Both connected to eschatology discussions
- Darby connected to Scofield

**The Scofield Bible**:
- One of first Study Bibles with margin notes
- Mass-printed, mass-produced, mass-published
- **Marty's Opinion**: "The Scofield Bible wrecked Christian theology in the modern era"
- Propagated teachings that were "nonsense"
- "We are now still deconstructing those things"
- Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins's "Left Behind" series comes from this
- This eschatological worldview became default but "was not the orthodox default coming up to this point"

**Common Thread**:
All these movements capitalized on:
- Newfound culture of freedom and independence
- American experience
- Pushing against colonial denominationalism
- Wanting something new, free, individual, independent

### Scientific and Political Challenges

**Charles Darwin**:
- Famous work in mid-19th century
- Seemed to work against Christian worldview
- Some Christians critiqued it
- Some critical thinkers in Christianity affirmed certain components

**Karl Marx**:
- Pursuing new political ideals
- Also seemed to work against Christian worldview

### The Social Gospel

**William Booth** (Methodist pastor):
- Founded the Salvation Army
- Became lead thinker shaping Christianity's social consciousness
- Gave rise to what many call the **Social Gospel**

**Understanding the Term**:
- Has negative connotation in conservative evangelical circles
- But movement was "simply trying to recapture practical and misplaced emphasis on caring for the poor"
- Caring for marginalized in increasingly industrialized world
- Gap between rich and poor rapidly increasing

**BEMA Connection**: This sounds familiar:
- The margins
- The mumzer/mamzer
- The alien, orphan, and widow
- "There is very much a social component to the Gospel from Genesis to Revelation"

**Secular Humanism**:
Secular aspect of this cultural growth curve was called "secular humanism" - trying to articulate similar values (caring for poor, justice) in political realm.

### The Eruption of Fundamentalism
After fighting World War I, Christendom in North America turned attention to fighting secular ideals.

**The Scopes Trial** (Dayton, Tennessee):
- Like a "lit powder keg"
- Led to eruption of Christian fundamentalism
- Christians immediately saw themselves in culture war with secular humanism

**The Dangerous Pattern**:
This "rings incredibly reminiscent" of what? **Copernicus and Galileo.**
- Remember geocentric to heliocentric shift?
- Everyone thought they were crazy
- Turns out there were things we needed to learn

"It seems that we may be in danger even today of misidentifying our enemy, and the truth that we should be fighting to preserve."

## Historical Context and Key Events

### The Complexity of Splintering
With all the division in Christianity:
- "It becomes harder and harder for us to learn from our mistakes"
- Every group has to make their own mistakes independently
- Less shared learning across denominational lines
- Earlier, Catholic theologians from France could influence broader church
- Now, with "a hundred different movements or a thousand different movements, how much can anyone have any influence?"

### War Always Hinders Progress
"It's interesting how war always hinders progress. Shocker there. War always seems to get in the way, every time."

After WWI, instead of continuing growth, energy turned to culture wars.

## Practical Applications

### Learning from Camp Meetings
The Second Great Awakening reminds us:
- Community worship experiences can be powerful
- Personal confession and repentance matter
- We need spaces for Holy Spirit movement
- Balance intellectual growth with spiritual experience

### The Restoration Ideal
Even if application fails, the Restoration Movement ideal teaches:
- Unity across denominational lines is possible
- Creeds and confessions can become tools of exclusion
- Simple commitment to Jesus and early church patterns is appealing
- We should keep working toward unity even after initial failures

### Avoiding the Fundamentalist Mistake
The fundamentalist response to evolution and modernism warns us:
- Don't repeat the Copernicus/Galileo error
- New scientific understanding may challenge theology without threatening God
- Misidentifying our enemy damages witness
- Culture war mentality rarely produces good fruit

### The Social Gospel Isn't Optional
Caring for the poor and marginalized is:
- Not a "liberal" political add-on to gospel
- Core to biblical message from Genesis to Revelation
- What William Booth and Social Gospel movement recovered
- Essential for holistic Christianity

### Handling Our Own Movements Critically
Marty models:
- Loving ideals of your tradition while critiquing application
- Being honest about problems in your movement
- Not defending your tribe at all costs
- Staying untethered to tribal identity while appreciating your roots

## Study Questions

1. Camp meetings emphasized Holy Spirit movement after period of heavy emphasis on academics and doctrine. How do we balance intellectual rigor with spiritual experience?

2. The Stone-Campbell Movement initially drew people together across denominational lines, but later splintered. Why do unity movements so often fragment? How can we do better?

3. Marty loves the ideals of his movement but often hates its application. How do you feel about your own tradition? Can you separate ideals from execution?

4. Why did so many new religious movements (Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventist, Restoration Movement) emerge in early 19th century America? What conditions made this possible?

5. Marty argues the Scofield Bible "wrecked Christian theology" by popularizing dispensationalism. How do we assess widely-accepted theological systems that may be wrong?

6. The Social Gospel has negative connotations in evangelical circles despite being rooted in biblical justice. How did caring for the poor become "liberal"? How do we reclaim it?

7. The fundamentalist response to evolution mirrors the church's reaction to Copernicus. Are we repeating this mistake today? On what issues?

8. With increasing splintering, "every group has to make their own set of mistakes independently." How can we learn from each other across denominational lines?

9. Marty tries to be generous to LDS family while maintaining "very key distinctions." How do we balance theological clarity with relational generosity?

10. Why did American freedom and independence produce both beautiful movements (Restoration ideal) and problematic ones (extreme splintering)?
