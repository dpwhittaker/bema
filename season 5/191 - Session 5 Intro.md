# Episode 191: Session 5 Intro

## Episode Metadata
- **Episode Number:** 191
- **Title:** Session 5 Intro
- **Season:** 5
- **Air Date:** October 15, 2020
- **Duration:** 21 minutes 24 seconds
- **Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings

## Episode Overview
This episode serves as the introduction to Session 5 of the BEMA podcast, which will explore church history from the end of Revelation to the present day. Before embarking on that journey, Marty and Brent provide a comprehensive review of everything covered in Sessions 1-4, creating a roadmap of the entire biblical narrative.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Importance of Sequential Learning
The hosts emphasize the critical importance of listening to Sessions 1-4 before beginning Session 5. The podcast is structured as a consistent narrative that builds from the very first episode. They acknowledge that many listeners have skipped Session 2 (the Old Testament journey), but stress that doing so means missing essential concepts like:
- Two stories, one source
- The prophetic table
- Different voices in Scripture

The cumulative nature of the content makes jumping ahead like "watching only the last 20 minutes of a movie" - you miss the character development and the established world.

### Session 5 Focus: Church History
Session 5 will address fundamental questions:
- Where are we today?
- How did we get here?
- What happened in the vast space between when Revelation ended and where we are now?

The session will conclude by summing up the big ideas of the entire BEMA body of work and inspire listeners to walk it out together.

## Biblical Narrative Structure: The Short Review

### Torah - Partnership
The five books of Moses center on the concept of partnership between God and His people:
- **Genesis:** The basis of the partnership; meeting the characters involved
- **Exodus:** The formal choosing; God chooses a partner, the partner chooses God (marriage)
- **Leviticus:** Defining the partnership; "What is the partnership going to look like?"
- **Numbers:** Shaping the partner; God molds His people in the desert
- **Deuteronomy:** Remembering; God asks His partner to remember everything the partnership was built upon

### History - Redemption Cycle and God's Patience
- **Joshua:** God places His people in the middle of the action, at the crossroads of the earth
- **Judges and Ruth:** God's people struggle to walk the path of God and trust the story; mixed results of struggle, victory, failure, and success
- **Samuel and Kings:** Struggles with identity and obedience; becoming people of integrity and morality
- **Chronicles:** The lens of empire; becoming the anti-story; injustice takes root when people forget to bless all nations and only bless self

### Wisdom Literature - Tools for the Journey
In the midst of struggle (both positive and negative), God provides tools for survival:
- **Psalms:** Art and song for worship and expression; connection beyond head knowledge
- **Proverbs:** Nuggets of conventional wisdom
- **Ecclesiastes:** Purpose and reason to get up every morning
- **Song of Songs:** Relationships and intimacy

### Prophets - Warning, Woes, and Hope
- **Warning:** Pre-Assyrian/Babylonian prophets (Amos, Hosea, Micah, First Isaiah, Zephaniah, Second Isaiah)
- **Woes:** Pronouncing judgment (Jonah, Nahum, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Habakkuk, Obadiah, Joel)
- **Hope:** Encouragement to exiled people (Ezekiel, Daniel, Job, Third Isaiah)

### The Remnant - Returning, Yearning, and Learning
After Cyrus the Great allows God's people to return home:
- **Returning:** Rebuild and restore what once was (Fourth Isaiah, Ezra, Nehemiah)
- **Yearning:** For what used to be (Haggai, Zechariah)
- **Learning:** This new world demands a new approach (Malachi, Esther)

### Silent Years - Synagogue and Hellenism
The period between the Old and New Testaments (not actually silent):
- **Synagogue:** Return to the Text; passionate devotion; new education system; becoming people of the Scriptures
- **Hellenism:** Man as the measure of all things; upended value system; self-preservation vs. biblical self-sacrifice; Empire vs. Shalom

Five different responses emerged:
1. **Sadducees:** Corrupt partnership despite being called by God
2. **Herodians:** Compromising idolatry despite perfect placement for God's mission
3. **Essenes:** Absolute devotion to the Text, but isolated
4. **Pharisees:** Absolute devotion to obedience; lost compassion in pursuit of righteousness
5. **Zealots:** Zeal and action, but using imperial means (Rome's weapons)

### Gospels - The Story in Flesh
Jesus incarnates the entire Tanakh; the narrative walks among us:
- **Matthew:** God's commitment to the mumzer/mamzer (the outcast)
- **Mark:** Everything that Rome needs to hear
- **Luke:** An ordered parashah companion to the story read every week
- **John:** Relevant for the Greco-Asian/Greco-Roman world; the grafted story of Jew and Gentile together

### Acts - Epilogue of an Early Church
What happens when the Kingdom of Empire meets the Kingdom of God empowered by the Holy Spirit:
- The people of God remember their call to bless all nations
- A very Jewish church in a very Gentile context

### Early Church Letters - Text to Context
Applying ancient truth to specific situations:
- **Paul's Letters:** Applying the way of Jesus to each unique context (Philippi, Ephesus, Corinth, Thessalonica, etc.)
- **Hebrews:** Instructing Hebrew believers to persevere in the face of a destroyed temple; Jesus has a better way
- **James:** Doing the mitzvot with purpose; mitzvot makes faith alive and real for Jewish readers; how Jews impact the world
- **Peter:** Holy living as God's chosen people
- **John:** Loving others is the truth
- **Jude:** Using the apocryphal and midrash to exalt God's people and call them to a better walk

### Revelation - Using the Past to Illuminate the Present
Using Tanakh, apocalyptic literature, past experiences, and past story to illuminate present experience; text to context.

## Practical Applications

### Visual Learning Tools
Marty encourages listeners to create visual representations of the biblical narrative:
- Use a whiteboard to map out the entire arc
- Create timelines on butcher paper
- See the big picture by backing up far enough
- Share photos of created timelines with the BEMA team

### Community Engagement
Multiple ways to connect with and support BEMA:
- Financial support through recurring monthly donations
- Sign up for the Messenger newsletter
- Join or register small groups on the interactive map
- Leave reviews on podcast platforms
- Visit bemadiscipleship.com for events, trips, and Jewish holiday calendars

### The Value of the "Unsexy Work"
Marty's transparency about administrative overhead reminds listeners that sustainable ministry requires:
- Regular financial support (even small amounts like $8-10/month make a difference)
- Understanding that 100 people giving $10/month creates significant monthly income
- Recognition that overhead and administrative costs are essential for organizational health

## Study Questions

1. How does viewing Torah through the lens of "partnership" rather than just "law" change your understanding of God's relationship with His people?

2. In what ways do the five responses to Hellenism (Sadducees, Herodians, Essenes, Pharisees, Zealots) mirror contemporary Christian responses to cultural pressure?

3. How does the concept of "text to context" in the early church letters inform how we should apply Scripture to our modern contexts?

4. What is the significance of understanding church history when trying to answer "where are we today and how did we get here"?

5. How does the progression from "returning, yearning, and learning" in the remnant period relate to modern faith communities experiencing transition or restoration?

6. Why is it important to understand that the "silent years" were not actually silent? What does this teach us about God's activity in seasons when He seems absent?

7. How does the concept that Jesus is "the story in flesh" - the incarnation of the entire Tanakh - change how you read the Gospels?

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Tanakh:** The Hebrew Bible (Torah, Prophets, Writings)
- **Mumzer/Mamzer:** A person of illegitimate birth; an outcast
- **Parashah:** Weekly Torah portion read in synagogue
- **Mitzvot:** Commandments; good deeds
- **Midrash:** Jewish biblical interpretation and commentary
- **Hellenism:** Greek culture and philosophy; the worldview that man is the measure of all things
- **Shalom:** Biblical peace; wholeness; flourishing; right relationships
- **Deuterocanonical:** Books included in some biblical canons but not others (the Apocrypha)

## Theological and Historical Insights

### The Arc of Scripture
The short review demonstrates that Scripture is not a disconnected collection of books but a unified narrative with clear movements:
1. Partnership established (Torah)
2. Partnership tested through cycles of redemption (History)
3. Tools provided for the journey (Wisdom)
4. Warnings and hope delivered (Prophets)
5. Return and adaptation (Remnant)
6. Cultural collision (Silent Years)
7. Incarnation of the narrative (Gospels)
8. Spirit-empowered expansion (Acts)
9. Contextual application (Letters)
10. Present reality illuminated by past story (Revelation)

### Empire vs. Kingdom
A recurring theme throughout the review is the tension between Empire (self-preservation, power, control) and the Kingdom of God (self-sacrifice, blessing others, Shalom). This tension:
- Emerges in Chronicles when Israel becomes the anti-story
- Intensifies during Hellenism
- Manifests in different group responses (Sadducees through Zealots)
- Confronts Rome in the book of Acts
- Continues into church history (the focus of Session 5)

### Blessing All Nations
The original Abrahamic call to be a blessing to all nations serves as a measuring stick throughout Scripture:
- When God's people remember this call, they flourish (Acts)
- When they forget and only bless self, injustice takes root (Chronicles)
- Jesus embodies this call perfectly in His ministry to the mumzer
- Paul applies it contextually to each unique setting

## Ministry Update Notes

### Financial Sustainability
Marty provides transparent updates about BEMA's financial needs:
- Initial response to funding requests was "unbelievable" but has since dipped
- Regular, recurring donations (even small amounts) are more valuable than one-time gifts
- Recent loss of a major donor has impacted the Solomon family's personal ministry account
- Multiple giving options available: BEMA Ministry, general fund, staff support

### Brent's Transition
Since January 2020, Brent has been working full-time on BEMA rather than doing it "on the side":
- Allows more study and preparation for episodes
- Improves overall well-being
- Enables more ambitious future plans

### Future Vision
Marty hints at "big plans" and "big dreams" for BEMA's future that haven't been fully shared yet, contingent on financial support.

## Closing Thoughts

This episode serves as both a review and a bridge. The comprehensive recap ensures that all listeners, regardless of when they joined the BEMA journey, have access to the complete narrative framework. By condensing Sessions 1-4 into memorable categories and phrases, it creates mental hooks that make the entire biblical story more accessible and retainable.

The emphasis on visual learning tools (whiteboards, timelines, butcher paper) acknowledges that different people internalize information differently and that seeing the "big picture" requires literally backing up far enough to see the whole arc.

Most importantly, this episode sets up the central question of Session 5: In the vast space between when Revelation ended and where we are now, what happened? Understanding church history isn't just academic curiosity - it's essential for answering "where are we today and how did we get here?" The biblical narrative doesn't end with Revelation; it continues through church history and into our present moment.
