# BEMA Episode 197: AD 1000-1300

## Episode Overview
This episode examines one of the darkest chapters in Christian history: the Crusades. Marty and Brent explore how a common enemy briefly unified a fracturing Christendom, the rise of Scholasticism, and the growing gap between the educated elite and the common people. The episode confronts uncomfortable truths about Christian history that we must wrestle with rather than disown.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Crusades: A Dark Chapter
Following the East-West Schism, the Western Church faced a crisis of papal authority. The saying "nothing brings people together like a common enemy" captures what happened next:

- The Islamic movement toward Palestine provided a "perfect opportunity" for the Church to find a common enemy
- This was used as a potential scapegoat to bring unity to struggling Christendom
- The Crusades were largely ineffective by any measuring stick
- Very successful at killing people, unsuccessful at spreading faith or accomplishing stated objectives

**Marty's Position**: He makes no attempt to put a "positive spin" on the Crusades. This chapter of Christian history is dark and marked with problems that most have kept "out of sight and out of mind."

### The Problem of Historical Memory
Christians often resist apologizing for historical wrongs, asking: "Why would I apologize for something that happened centuries ago?"

This question reveals our "blatant disconnection from our faith and where it comes from." The episode contrasts this with:
- **Jewish historical memory**: "WE were in Egypt... WE were in the desert" - they own every part of their history
- **Christian selective memory**: We tend to identify with the good parts and disown the dark chapters

The principle: **"A dark history disowned by the descendants of it will be bound to repeat itself."**

### Who Fights the Wars?
A crucial observation about the Crusades (and wars in general):
- Not everyone fights - they never do
- The poor, uneducated, and commoners do the fighting
- The wealthy, influential, and leaders make decisions but don't fight
- Leaders offer "ridiculous sums of money" to get people to fight, knowing many won't survive and won't need to be paid

This dynamic echoes the slavery in Egypt from Session 1 - it's Empire versus Shalom, stick versus invitation, force versus voice.

### The Rise of Scholasticism
While the middle and bottom classes fought the crusades, an intellectual revolution occurred among the elite:

- An ever-widening gap between those who have and those who have not
- Driven by education and academic privilege
- With the rise of science, a university system emerged that we still use today
- Apprentices learned reading, writing, mathematics, science, theology, and arts
- Much of this was driven by Greek philosophy from the Hellenistic Era

**Key Figure: Thomas Aquinas**
- Changed the face of Christian history
- Brought logical order to many fields of education
- Showed how mathematics and science could blend with philosophy and theology
- Often called "the father of logic and reason"
- Shaped how we understand education systems today

### The Lost Connection to Judaism
Marty observes that approximately 1,000 years after the Judaic movement of Jesus, Christendom had profoundly lost crucial elements:

- We lost things "absolutely crucial to the health of the Church"
- While we're "still enamored with the pillars of Hellenism today," we should critically examine how lost we became
- The church needed to question just how far it had drifted from its roots

## Historical Context and Key Events

### Impact of the Crusades
The few centuries of the Crusades were "an absolute mess" that seemed to create an "unfortunate unity in Christendom." The unifying effect came through:
- A shared enemy
- A common (though misguided) purpose
- Military campaigns that engaged broad segments of society

### The Gap Between Classes
The period saw dramatic inequality:
- **The elite**: Received unprecedented education, studied in emerging universities, had access to knowledge
- **The masses**: Fought wars, remained largely illiterate, depended on clergy for spiritual knowledge
- **The middle class**: Largely engaged in the crusades while the educated elite pursued scholarship

### Blue Like Jazz and Historical Confession
The episode references Donald Miller's "Blue Like Jazz," particularly the chapter about the "reverse confessional" at Reed College:
- Instead of receiving confessions, they offered confessions on behalf of the Christian faith
- Both current and historic wrongs were confessed
- Many Christians resist this, not understanding the importance of owning our collective history

### Jesus and Church History
A powerful story from a trip to Israel:
- A Jewish guide was asked why Jews don't follow Jesus
- His response: "We as Jews have never been able to understand how Christians can see Jesus in a vacuum. We can't see Jesus just as this independent Jewish rabbi 2,000 years ago. For us, Jesus is connected to 1,800 years of brutal Church history, much of which has been just filled with the slaughter of people in the name of this Jesus."

This perspective should go with us for a long time - we cannot separate Jesus from how his followers have acted in history.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**The Crusades**: Military campaigns by Western Christianity (primarily 1095-1291) aimed at capturing Palestine from Islamic control, which slaughtered millions in Jesus's name

**Scholasticism**: The educational movement combining theology, philosophy, and science using systematic, logical methods; emerged in medieval universities

**Thomas Aquinas**: Medieval theologian and philosopher who systematized Christian thought using Aristotelian logic, profoundly shaping Western Christian theology and education

**Social Gospel**: Movement championed by figures like William Booth emphasizing Christianity's practical care for the poor and marginalized

**Secular Humanism**: Philosophical stance emphasizing human reason, ethics, and justice while rejecting religious dogma

**Fundamentalism**: Religious movements emphasizing strict adherence to foundational beliefs; addressed in Karen Armstrong's "Battle for God"

**The Scopes Trial**: 1925 Tennessee trial about teaching evolution, which crystallized fundamentalist-modernist tensions

## Practical Applications

### Owning Our History
We must develop a more Jewish approach to historical memory:
- Own both the good and dark chapters of Christian history
- Understand that disowning dark history makes us likely to repeat it
- Practice corporate confession for historic wrongs
- Recognize that individual and corporate identity are intertwined

### Avoiding Tribal Prejudice
The episode warns against defining other faiths by their extremists:
- Christians don't want to be defined by fringe radicals
- Yet we often define Islam or other religions by their most extreme expressions
- The Islamic movement toward Palestine "did not represent the Islamic faith as a whole"
- We should extend to others the same grace we want for ourselves

### Recognizing Empire Dynamics
The pattern of the powerful sending the poor to fight continues:
- In the Crusades
- Throughout history
- Even today in various forms
- This is Empire, not Shalom
- This is Egypt, not the way of Jesus

### Critical Self-Examination
Rather than defending our tribe, we should:
- Think critically about Christian history
- Examine where we've gone wrong
- Learn from mistakes
- Avoid repeating patterns of violence and coercion

## Study Questions

1. Why is it important to own the dark chapters of Christian history rather than disown them? How does the Jewish concept of "WE were in Egypt" challenge Christian historical memory?

2. The episode states that "a dark history disowned by the descendants of it will be bound to repeat itself." Where do you see evidence of this principle? How might Christians repeating crusade-era mistakes today?

3. How does the dynamic of "the wealthy make decisions, the poor fight wars" reflect Empire rather than Shalom? Where do you see this pattern continuing today?

4. What's your reaction to the Jewish guide's statement that Jews can't see Jesus apart from 1,800 years of brutal church history? How should this shape Christian witness?

5. Why does Marty resist putting a "positive spin" on the Crusades? What's the danger in historical revisionism that tries to justify Christian violence?

6. The rise of Scholasticism brought advances in education and thought, yet also widened the gap between elite and common people. How do we assess such developments that have both positive and negative effects?

7. How can we appreciate thinkers like Thomas Aquinas while also recognizing what was lost when Christianity became increasingly Hellenized and distant from Jewish roots?

8. The episode contrasts defining our own faith generously while defining other faiths by their extremists. Where do you see this double standard operating? How can we correct it?

"Nothing brings people together like a common enemy." - On how the Crusades unified Christendom

"A dark history disowned by the descendants of it will be bound to repeat itself." - Marty Solomon

"We as Jews have never been able to understand how Christians can see Jesus in a vacuum. We can't see Jesus just as this independent Jewish rabbi 2,000 years ago. For us, Jesus is connected to 1,800 years of brutal Church history, much of which has been just filled with the slaughter of people in the name of this Jesus." - Jewish tour guide

"We studied Judaism of the Second Temple period and its different sects of Judaism—its five different responses to Hellenism. We have seen the same movements grow and disappear within Christian history as well." - Marty Solomon on patterns across religions

"This is very clearly Empire to me. We identified, all the way back in Session 1, what Empire looked like, and what Shalom looked like... This is not that, this is not even close to that... This is Egypt. This is Pharaoh." - Marty Solomon on the Crusades
