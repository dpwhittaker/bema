# BEMA Episode 204: Session 5 Capstone

## Episode Overview
The final episode of the core BEMA curriculum. Marty reads two powerful pieces by Sarah Bessey - "The Benediction" and "The Commissioning" - offering blessing, commissioning, and hope for the journey ahead. The episode also previews Session 6 and discusses the future of BEMA, including continuing content, video experiments, and the importance of financial support.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Journey is Complete (But Not Over)

**What's Finished**:
- The journey through history from "b'reisheit bara Elohim" to today
- The foundation (Sessions 1-5)
- The core material
- Started in 2016 (podcast); material development since 2008; Brent studying since 2013

**What's Coming**:
- Session 6: "Postscripts" (tentative name, subject to change)
- More audio content on regular basis
- Potentially video content
- YouTube presence
- Small group resources (though NOT discussion questions)
- Various experimental formats

**Marty's Promise**:
Will NOT make discussion questions because "I would ruin what so many brilliant ideas you guys are giving."

May make video plugs for each episode: "If I were having a group about this episode, here are the big ideas I would be wrestling with."

### The Benediction (by Sarah Bessey)

From **"Out of Sorts: Making Peace With an Evolving Faith"**

This reading captures the journey of sorting through faith, the wilderness of doubt and discovery, and the transformation that happens along the way. Key themes:

**The Wilderness Journey**:
- We sit in mess of half-unpacked boxes
- Nothing romantic about sorting through lifetime of questions
- We sort on threshold of grief and change (liminal space)
- A trail of baggage left behind
- Gradually becoming unencumbered

**What Gets Left Behind**:
- Cynicism, hypocrisy, lies
- Numbing techniques, apologetics, doctrinal statements
- Worldview, pomposity, opinions
- Carefully constructed personas
- Sins, righteousness, secrets
- "All of it will become filthy rags"
- Eventually "flinging them off the wagon, glad to be rid of them"

**Streams in the Desert**:
Those who love the gospel hand you water

**The Other Side**:
- Freedom and deliverance waiting
- Won't look like the travel brochure
- Will love the wind and wild
- Love freckles and sun's weathering
- Love song of stars more than contents of life
- More than tidy sealed boxes and certainty

**The Secret**:
You'll still feel the call in the wind beckoning further
- Another journey ahead
- Another betwixt-and-between
- Part of you will look forward to nights alone on prairie when God's voice sings clear
- You're a pioneer, explorer, adventurer
- "Carry on"

**The Prayer of Benediction**:
Prays for:
- Bravery, guts, honesty, discernment
- Remembering God isn't threatened by you
- No fear in love; perfect love drives out fear
- Knowing Jesus deeply and intimately
- Falling in step with the man from Nazareth
- Right to learn, test, read, explore in Body of Christ
- Being an explorer with delight, wonder, curiosity
- Bible capturing imagination and heart again
- Healing from any abuse in name of Scripture
- Scripture changing life, tongue, mind, world
- Finding your place in the Church (you ARE beloved member)
- Creating what you're craving (you aren't alone)
- Small handful of somewheres (not too many, just a few)
- Authenticity, realness, shedding masks
- Embracing place in Kingdom of God (already here)
- Remembering you're part of big, glorious story
- Active, intimate leading of Holy Spirit
- Bearing fruit of the Spirit
- Honoring your hunger and thirst
- Heart being broken and anger being woken up
- Being a learner, listener, humble worker
- Lifting heads from despair to find the family
- Remembering: You belong here; there's room for you
- Finding holy in daily life
- Waking up to life happening now
- Journey unfolding into unknown

**Final Word**:
"Beloved, in the mighty and powerful name of Jesus. Amen."
(Sarah Bessy, Epiphany 2015)

### The Commissioning (by Sarah Bessey)

From **"Jesus Feminist"**

Marty reads this with every generation of BEMA students (since April 2015, just before Brent finished his first round).

**The Setting**:
"Come and stand in front of me. Stand on your own two feet... at the water's edge"

**The Commissioning**:
In the mighty and powerful name of Jesus:
- Commissioned for work of the gospel
- As minister of Jesus Christ
- To live as ambassador of the kingdom
- In work of healing, serving, loving, reconciliation
- As emissary of justice
- To put things right
- To call those things that are not as they will be

**The Prayers**:
For:
- God of hope to fill you with peace that passes understanding
- Community so rich, deep, diverse you'll disagree, fight, remain in fellowship anyway
- Gift of realizing you were wrong about important things
- Quickly seeking forgiveness when you're the transgressor

**The Declaration**:
STOP waiting for someone else to say:
- You count
- You matter
- You have worth
- You have a voice, a place
- You are called

**The Truth**:
The One who knit you together in your mother's womb is singing these words over you:
- You are chosen
- Stop waiting to earn through apologetics, memorized arguments
- Through your quietness, submission, home, children, correct doctrine
- God has already freely given
- You are valuable
- You have worth not because of gender, vocation, marital status
- Not because of labels, approved books, accomplishments
- In Christ, you have value beyond all that
- You abide in love
- You can rest in your God-breathed worth
- God has called you by name
- Written your name on palm of his hands
- You are knitted together, loved, rescued already

**Now Go and Do**:
You know Jesus. You've experienced power and grace.
- Now go, heal, disciple, minister, love
- Loosen chains, throw open doors
- Speak, breathe, prophesy
- Get behind pulpit and preach
- Mark exam papers, run company or non-profit
- Clean kitchen, put paint on canvas
- Organize, rabble-rouse
- Find transcendence in laundry pile while you pray in obscurity
- Deliver babies for Haitian mothers
- Work the love out and in and around you
- However God made you and placed you to do it
- Just do it
- Don't let lies fence you in or hold you back

**Love**:
- Love your spouse, babies, poor, orphans, widows
- Love powerful, broken, hurting, friends, yourself, enemies
- Love until you love whole world
- Love fullness of God
- Love full expression of image-bearer He created you to be
- Just that. No more, but certainly no less

**Choose Freedom**:
- Freedom of living loved
- Far from debates, fence lines, name-calling
- Extend gift of freedom and grace, second chances
- As E.E. Cummings wrote: "Take courage to grow up and turn out to be who you really are"

**Live Counter-Culturally**:
When culture (baptized or secular) doesn't affirm:
- Truth, love, faith, mercy, justice

**Why It Matters**:
- Because you matter
- Your daughters and sons matter
- Sisters and brothers matter
- People of God and entirety of created world matters
- Mission of God matters
- Redemption matters
- Whether silenced in Illinois or India
- Whether actual breathing life or soul life

**The Work**:
- Keep prophesying our very lives
- Keep worshiping, loving
- Keep making space for God in world and in each other
- Space for holy grace to fill
- Kingdom of God will be better with your voice, hands, experiences, stories, truth
- You are someone's invitation

**Rest in Your God-Breathed Worth**:
Stop:
- Holding your breath
- Hiding your gifts
- Ducking your head
- Dulling your roar
- Distracting your soul
- Stilling your hands
- Quieting your voice
- Satiating hunger with lesser things

**More Prayers**:
For:
- Messy living rooms, late nights, dirty dishes
- Faithful handful of friends and family
- Being quick to show up at right time
- Joy
- Setting you apart in right-now life for daily work of liberation and love
- Soul longing for prayer and scriptures
- Keeping secrets, giving away money, sharing meals
- Sitting alone in silence satisfied
- Changing bedding without anger after child's accident
- Holding babies, comforting dying
- Being voice of knowledge tempered with grace and wisdom
- Never forgetting how to sing and be silly
- Making room to be inconvenienced and put out
- Being Jesus with skin on for a few people
- Fearlessness and eating good food
- Walking in knowledge of sacredness and purpose of calling
- Dreams and visions
- Active leading of Holy Spirit
- Remembering Abba is very fond of you
- What a friend you have in Jesus
- Perseverance, discipline
- Speech seasoned with salt
- When bored, tired, discouraged, frustrated
- When feeling futile, small, ridiculous
- You will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP

**Your Ministry Begins**:
- Begins now
- Began long ago
- Turn around and face your life
- Look it in eye
- Because this, right now, this is it
- Surrounded by jelly-faced toddlers or thousands of souls
- In hospital, back alley, church, orphanage, suburban kitchen
- Giving voice for dozens or only one other soul
- You are a minister

**Feel It. Say the Words**:
- You have been commissioned for work of gospel and Christ Jesus
- Keep eyes open for signs of God's presence
- He is already at work in your world
- You get to be part of it

**We're in This Together**:
"Let's do this"
- We're calling people outside to bonfire
- Lots of us here waiting for you in open air
- Been here all along
- Been ministering, preaching, praying, teaching, loving, mothering, caring, singing, walking each other home
- Glorious and messy
- Far away from limitations, barriers of restricted religion
- We, the people of God, are here with you
- We are family, your family
- We've been waiting for you

**Sending Out**:
- I send you out to spot where you are right now
- You are right now where you belong
- You have everything you need to begin
- We will walk it out together
- You are part of redemptive movement of God in world
- For His daughters and sons
- You and me, we are kingdom people
- An outpost of redemption
- Engaged in God's mission of reconciliation
- Blessed be His kingdom now and forevermore
- Peace be with you, my friend
- Peace

**Marty's Closing**: "Would those be our words too—to you. Thanks for making it to this spot with us."

## Study Questions

1. Sarah Bessey writes about leaving a trail of baggage behind in the wilderness. What baggage have you left behind on your BEMA journey? What are you still carrying that you need to release?

2. "Stop waiting for someone else to validate your created self. That is done." Why do we wait for human validation when God has already called and chosen us?

3. You are commissioned as "a minister of Jesus Christ" right where you are. How does this reframe your daily life and calling?

4. "This, right now, this is it." How does this challenge our tendency to wait for our "real life" to start?

5. The commissioning says "you will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP" even when feeling futile, small, ridiculous. What keeps you going when you feel this way?

6. "We are kingdom people, an outpost of redemption engaged in God's mission of reconciliation." What does this look like practically in your context?

7. Both readings emphasize community: "We've been waiting for you." How does knowing others are on this journey encourage you?

8. Sarah Bessey prays for "gift of realizing you were wrong about important things." What have you been wrong about? How has that been a gift?

9. The benediction describes the wilderness as "beautiful and terrifying, and intimate." Which word best describes your BEMA journey? Why?

10. Looking back over all five sessions, what's the one thing you most want to carry forward? What's your first step?

## Personal Reflection

This capstone marks not an ending but a new beginning. You've journeyed from Genesis to today, from Empire to Shalom, from exile to homecoming. You've been commissioned. You've been blessed. You've been sent.

Now turn around and face your life.

This is it.

And you have everything you need.

Peace be with you.
