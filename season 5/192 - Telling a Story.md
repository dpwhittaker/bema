# Episode 192: Telling a Story

## Episode Metadata
- **Episode Number:** 192
- **Title:** Telling a Story
- **Season:** 5
- **Air Date:** October 22, 2020
- **Duration:** 25 minutes 49 seconds
- **Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings

## Episode Overview
This critical disclaimer episode sets expectations for Session 5's journey through church history. Marty establishes three important parameters: he's not a professional historian, all historians tell stories with bias, and this session won't comprehensively cover church history. Instead, it will broadly examine how the Christian world has been shaped and what happened between Revelation and today.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Sticky and Dangerous Realm of History
Marty acknowledges a fundamental shift in authority from previous sessions:
- **Previous Sessions (1-4):** Discussed God-breathed Text; could lean on rabbis and biblical authority
- **Session 5:** Entering the realm of personal thoughts and opinions about history
- Despite this discomfort, the question "What happened between Revelation and today?" is incredibly important
- Not wrestling with this question would be a "huge disservice" to the study of the Text

### Message, Mode, and Milieu
A framework from Impact Campus Ministries (developed by Bill Westfall) for holistic discipleship:

**Message:** Understanding the whole story of God and His invitation to join that story
- Cannot adequately address this invitation without understanding what happened between the biblical world and our world today
- Church history is part of the complete message
- The story didn't end in Revelation; we are still part of that story

**Mode:** Engaging the whole self in learning
- Not just listening/learning, but engaging body, heart, and mind simultaneously
- Example: The BEMA Trip to Israel radically transforms because physical movement, emotional conviction, and intellectual learning happen all at once
- Holistic learning creates deeper transformation than purely cognitive approaches

**Milieu:** Intentional relationships within the story (environment/network)
- Having diverse relationships across brands, tribes, stripes, and age demographics
- Understanding that others are part of this grand narrative
- Creating an environment of intentional community

### Three Critical Disclaimers

**Disclaimer #1: Not a Historian**
- Neither Marty nor Brent are professional historians with Ph.D.s
- Marty has studied church history considerably (Bible college, personal study, ongoing research)
- Indebted to real experts (some studied with personally, some read from a distance)
- Request: "Please do not quote me as a source in regard to church history"
- Goal: Take things learned from others and think critically with listeners
- "Nothing more and also nothing less"

**Disclaimer #2: All Historians Tell Stories**
- **There is no such thing as an unbiased rendering of history**
- Every historian sees history through the lens of their own culture, language, experience, opinion, and conviction
- Marty will intentionally select parts of history that tell the story in the most useful manner for our culture, place, and time
- This is "completely intentional and biased"
- Warning: "Please do not ever believe anyone who doesn't affirm that very truth in their telling of history"
- All renderings of history have a story to tell; all historians are storytellers

**Biblical Precedent for Biased History:**
- Samuel/Kings appears in the Prophets (not Writings)
- Chronicles appears in Writings
- Jews understood that history was prophetic in nature
- Recording history = engaging in prophecy; being a mouthpiece for what God wants us to understand
- We should embrace this truth rather than run from it
- It should challenge us to think critically about our past

**Disclaimer #3: Not Covering the History of the Church Comprehensively**
- Intent is NOT to adequately cover church history in a comprehensive way
- Will NOT do detailed studies on the Reformers or Desert Fathers
- Will take a broad look at where we've been and how our Christian world has been shaped
- Will over-generalize all the time
- Trying not to mislead or be disingenuous, but staying within scope

**The Problem with Church History Study:**
Christians "lose their mind" with church history like they do with:
- Politics
- Revelation and eschatology

People dive into favorite pockets (Reformation, Anabaptists, Early Church Fathers) looking for direction, meaning, and purpose—but that was supposed to come from the Text.

### BEMA's Focus: The Text at the Center
The name "BEMA" signifies the central priority:
- The BEMA sat in the center of the synagogue
- You stand on it when you read the Scriptures
- The podcast/discipleship program centers around the Text
- NOT around our history, dogma, or doctrine
- "We're not doing church history to do church history. We're doing church history to understand how to apply the Text."

## Theological and Historical Insights

### Three-Part Eschatology
A crucial theological framework for understanding Session 5:

**Two-Part Eschatology (John the Baptist's view):**
- Hard break between "this age" and "the age to come"

**Three-Part Eschatology (Jesus's view):**
1. This age
2. Overlap period: The age to come begins and slowly fades in while this current age slowly fades out
3. Final state: Only the age to come

Jesus critiqued John the Baptist's two-part eschatology in favor of this three-part understanding.

### The Return of Christ and Partnership

**Early Christian Expectation:**
- Believed Christ's return was imminent (within decades, not centuries)
- Found in Scripture and early Christian writings

**Were They Wrong?**
Marty argues: No, they were not wrong, because:
- Jesus's return date is not fixed
- God is inviting us to partner with Him in restoring a broken world
- As the redemptive arc of history bends closer to God's intent, God will eventually "snap the last few pieces into place"

### Speeding the Coming (2 Peter 3:11-13)
Peter writes: "You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and **speed its coming**."

**Implications:**
- The day of God is not fixed
- It "stands in relation to us"
- Our obedience somehow speeds up its coming
- Rooted in Pharisaical school of eschatology

### Tikkun Olam - Repairing the World
A Jewish concept central to understanding Christian mission:
- Hebrew phrase meaning "repairing the world"
- Engaging in mitzvot (good deeds)
- Walking righteously
- Partnering with God in restoration

**Historical Application:**
The radical obedience of early believers was working:
- The most powerful empire in the world (Rome) was crumbling
- The dragon, the beast—all being done away with (Revelation imagery)
- They weren't wrong to think Christ's return was speedily approaching

### The Central Question of Session 5
"If Christ was right at the doorstep, what happened that led us to where we're at today?"

- The early church was radically obedient
- Their commitment was effective
- "Then something happened. We seem to lose the plot."
- Session 5 will examine what that "something" might have been

## Practical Applications

### Critical Thinking About Sources
When consuming church history (or any history):
- Recognize all historians have bias
- Be suspicious of anyone claiming objectivity
- Understand the storyteller's perspective and agenda
- Engage critically rather than passively accepting

### Holistic Engagement
Lessons from Mode:
- Learning shouldn't be purely cognitive
- Find ways to engage body, heart, and mind simultaneously
- Experience can radically transform understanding (like trips to Israel)
- Applied to church history: Don't just read about it; consider how it impacts you emotionally, physically, spiritually

### Maintaining Focus on the Text
Despite exploring church history:
- Keep Scripture at the center
- Don't get lost in favorite historical periods
- Use history to understand how to apply the Text
- Direction, meaning, and purpose come from the Text, not from historical movements

### Our Role in Speeding Christ's Return
Practical implications of 2 Peter 3:11-13:
- Holy and godly living has cosmic significance
- Our obedience participates in redemption
- Engaging in tikkun olam (repairing the world)
- Partnership with God in restoration, not passive waiting

## Study Questions

1. How does understanding that all historians (including biblical ones) tell stories with bias change the way you read historical accounts?

2. What are the dangers of diving into favorite pockets of church history (Reformation, Early Church Fathers, etc.) while looking for direction rather than finding it in the Text?

3. How does three-part eschatology differ from two-part eschatology, and why does this distinction matter for understanding church history?

4. If our obedience can "speed the coming" of Christ's return, what does this say about the nature of partnership with God? How does this change your understanding of salvation history?

5. What do you think it means that "we seem to lose the plot" after the early church's radical obedience was working? What might have happened?

6. How can we engage church history in a way that keeps the Text central rather than letting historical movements become our primary authority?

7. What does "tikkun olam" (repairing the world) look like in practical terms today? How does this connect to "speeding the coming" of Christ's return?

8. How does the concept of Message, Mode, and Milieu apply to your own discipleship journey? Which element is strongest/weakest in your current practice?

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Milieu:** An environment or social setting; in Impact Campus Ministries' framework, a network of intentional, diverse relationships within God's story
- **Message, Mode, and Milieu:** A discipleship framework emphasizing complete story understanding (message), whole-self engagement (mode), and intentional community (milieu)
- **Tikkun Olam:** Hebrew phrase meaning "repairing the world"; Jewish concept of partnering with God in restoration through righteous living and good deeds
- **Mitzvot:** Hebrew for commandments or good deeds
- **Three-Part Eschatology:** Jesus's view that "this age" and "the age to come" have an overlap period where both coexist before the final state
- **Two-Part Eschatology:** View (held by John the Baptist) that there's a hard break between "this age" and "the age to come"
- **BEMA:** The raised platform in the center of the synagogue where Scripture is read; symbolizes keeping the Text central

## Connections to Previous Episodes

### Session 4 and Revelation
- Session 5 picks up where Revelation ended
- Will start with AD 100-300 (after Domitian, end of 1st century)
- Addresses the question raised at the end of Session 4: "What happened between Revelation and where I sit today?"

### The Prophetic Nature of History
- Connects to Session 2 understanding that Samuel/Kings is in the Prophets, not Writings
- Chronicles tells the same history from a different prophetic perspective
- History-telling is itself a prophetic act

### Application of Previous Learning
- Session 5 reviews demonstrate the importance of understanding the big picture
- Every capstone episode included extensive review for this reason
- Can't adequately address God's invitation without understanding the whole story

## Theological Frameworks

### Partnership Theology
Throughout this episode, partnership with God is emphasized:
- God is looking for partners in His story
- We partner in tikkun olam (repairing the world)
- Our obedience participates in redemption
- We can "speed the coming" of restoration

### The Redemptive Arc of History
- History bends toward God's intent
- Not a fixed timeline but a responsive relationship
- Early church's radical obedience was bending the arc significantly
- "Something happened" that changed this trajectory

### Text-Centered Theology
- Scripture at the center, not history, dogma, or doctrine
- History serves to help us understand and apply the Text
- Don't seek direction primarily from historical movements
- The Bible is the authority; history is the context

## Closing Thoughts

This episode functions as an essential frame for everything that follows in Session 5. By establishing upfront that:
1. The hosts aren't professional historians
2. All history-telling is biased storytelling
3. This won't be comprehensive coverage

Marty creates space for critical thinking rather than passive acceptance. He's modeling intellectual honesty—acknowledging limitations while still engaging important questions.

The theological move connecting three-part eschatology with partnership theology is brilliant. If Christ's return isn't a fixed date but stands in relation to our obedience, then history becomes deeply significant. The early church's radical obedience was actually working—empire was crumbling, the kingdom was advancing.

"Then something happened. We seem to lose the plot."

This sets up the central mystery Session 5 will explore. The next episodes (covering AD 100-300 through modern times) will investigate what happened, how the church lost momentum, and what this means for applying the Text today.

The emphasis on keeping the Text central is crucial. Church history matters not as an end in itself, but as a means to understanding how to apply Scripture. The BEMA (Scripture-reading platform) sits at the center—everything else orbits around it.

Finally, the concept of "speeding the coming" transforms passivity into active partnership. We're not just waiting for Christ's return; our holy living, our engagement in tikkun olam, our obedience to the Text—these actually participate in redemption. History isn't just something that happens to us; we're co-creators with God, bending the arc of history toward His intent.
