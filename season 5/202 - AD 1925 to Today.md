# BEMA Episode 202: AD 1925 to Today

## Episode Overview
This episode brings church history to the present day, examining Christian fundamentalism, the Evangelical Church, postmodernity, the Emerging Church, and where we find ourselves today. Marty explores the last century's journey from fundamentalism through World War II to modern evangelicalism, the rise of the internet, and the collision of academic biblical scholarship with grassroots faith.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### Fundamentalism vs. Theological Liberalism: The Only Two Options
For a decade starting around 1925, fundamentalism and secular humanism were "locked in a fierce battle for truth."

**What happened to those who rejected fundamentalism?**
- At this point in history, they often drifted toward **theological liberalism**
- While we eventually learned to have more progressive conversation with more options on the table
- This wasn't that point in history yet
- You really had a world trying to navigate between just two options

**The Two Bad Options**:
- **Fundamentalism**: Strict adherence to doctrines, fighting against modernism and secular humanism
- **Theological Liberalism**: Often felt like "a weak take on humanism with Jesus slapped on the label"

Looking back now: "The two options that most 20th-century Christians had to choose from, seem today like equally bad options."

**Marty's Personal Grounding**:
Despite all his critical questioning and deconstructing of fundamentalism:
> "My Christian fundamentalist parents taught me, my churches that I grew up in taught me to, above all else, love Jesus and the Bible; and for that, I'm deeply grateful, I'm deeply indebted to them."

**What BEMA Represents**:
"BEMA is, 100 years later, a bringing back of these two worlds":
- Academic/critical thought and textual criticism
- Grassroots fundamentalist love for Jesus and Scripture
- These two worlds took separate paths for a while to navigate nuances
- Toward end of the century, they began coming back together and colliding
- "BEMA's the result of that collision"

### World War II Changes Everything
"Any hope that humanity could usher in some type of utopian societal existence—whether it was by fascist, socialist, communist, or even democratic means—would come to a crashing end."

Every humanistic worldview showed its true self in:
- Unbelievable genocide
- Communist oppression
- Nuclear war

**Simple Conclusion**: "Humanity isn't as great as we thought it was."

This gave Christianity "a great and sudden turnaround" - ushering in:
- The modern evangelistic era
- The eventual rise of the Evangelical Church

### The Rise of Modern Evangelicalism
Fundamentalism gives way to "a broader, softer version of itself":
- Wider presentation of Protestant American Christianity
- Beliefs justifying evangelical orthodoxy changed depending on who you asked
- Attempted to "plant its flag and set up its defenses"

**Important Note**: "We still find ourselves in this tension today."

**The Culture Wars**:
Modern evangelical church's culture wars are:
- NOT "the great promised land of our day"
- NOT "the last and final Armageddon that we often want them to be"
- **At best**: "Simply the awkward phases of a modern evangelicalism that is going through a sociological puberty"
- **At worst**: "The final gasping breaths of a movement coming to a very unflattering end"

"We would do well to consider these things."

### Billy Graham and Bill Bright: Greatest Evangelists
The modern evangelical movement was created by some greatest evangelists of our era:

**Billy Graham**: Famous evangelist who helped navigate this difficult era

**Bill Bright**: Founder of Campus Crusade for Christ (now Cru)

Together they:
- Helped church navigate very difficult era
- Gave church a language for communicating Gospel like never before
- Created cultural engagement unprecedented in history

**Historical Significance**:
> "I believe history might look back on this era with a similar perspective to our view of the printing press or the Reformation."

**The Four Spiritual Laws**:
- Created by Bill Bright
- "No matter how you or I might feel about their theological accuracy" (that's all Marty says!)
- Created world where college students, co-workers, soccer moms could articulate Jesus movement in simple language
- Evangelism now in hands of normal everyday parishioners, not just clergy

### The 1970s Jesus Movement
- Huge wave of people welcoming Jesus into hearts
- "Jesus the Christ is living inside of me"
- Newfound fervor in modern era for movement of Jesus
- Brent's mom got saved in 1975 - "a child of the Jesus Movement"

### Jacob Neusner and the Academic Revolution
About the same time (1970s), another revolution was happening in **academia**:

**Jacob Neusner**:
- Jewish literary scholar with Orthodox roots
- NOT a Christian believer
- Academic Jew attempting to understand how modern Christian thought influenced Jewish thought
- Brought modern Christian scholars (mostly Catholic at that time) to the table
- They found themselves learning lessons from Judaism that had "gone missing some 1800 years ago"

**The Impact**:
> "Academic Christians would never again engage in scholastic research or archeology, without the aid of their Jewish brothers."

**Realizing What Was Lost**:
> "We never repaired that schism for 1800 years. We went down our own stream of thought, our own stream of consciousness. We had councils and reformations, and great movements throughout history, but they were all very Gentile. Now, 1800 years later, these two worlds collide again, this Jewish and Gentile world, on a scholastic level, on an academic level in the world of scholarship."

**Discovery**:
> "All of a sudden we discover things that—people look at this discussion and they say, 'That's crazy, nobody was asking these questions for 1800 years?' Sometimes, the answer to that question is, 'Nope.'"

**Why Didn't We Know?**
> "We just hadn't asked. Until the work of Neusner and others, Christendom had been too worried about doctrinal purity, and theological rightness to ask basic questions about the Bible's long-lost Jewish context."

**BEMA's Debt to Neusner**:
> "BEMA is not just indebted—this whole discussion would not happen without the work of Jacob Neusner, period."

### The Rise of Kingdom Theology: N.T. Wright
Since turn of century, evangelical churches are beginning to experience this scholarly work:

**N.T. Wright**:
- Changed theology significantly
- "Just stands on the shoulders of a conversation that started just right in front of him"
- Brought whole new set of questions to scholarship
- Led entire Kingdom theology movement (not just him, but with him)

**The 20-30 Year Gap**:
Marty's professors told him new discoveries take 20-30 years to reach the church:
1. Discoveries vetted
2. Handed to educational institutions (universities/seminaries)
3. Taught to eventual pastors
4. Who then teach from pulpits (or podcasts/blog posts)

**The Internet Changes Everything**:
- With rise of internet, distribution of information (good AND bad) increases exponentially
- The curve is shortening, speeding up
- What took 30-40 years now happens much faster

### Quantum Science: The World Changes Again
While modern era produced scientific belief that "we would be able to figure out everything if given enough time" (secular humanism), we don't live in that world anymore post-WWII.

**Discovery of Quantum Science**:
- Radically changed everything
- Most basic principles of physics and Newtonian movement no longer applied
- Scientific world reeled at implications
- Combined with sociological realizations of the century = major worldview shift

**Result**: While humanism took major hit, secularism was and is "far from dead."

**The Most Shocking Shift**:
> "Since the days of the French Revolution, this might be the most shocking shift Christendom has yet to accept. We're still in denial about this."

While we talk about post-Christian culture in some circles:
> "We have not figured out how to respond well to it."

### Postmodernity and the Emerging Church
Late 1990s cultural cry: **"What do we truly know anyway?"**

Whether society, politics, or science - absolutes weren't as absolute as once thought.

**Church Response**:
- Church cried out against what they perceived as "moral relativism"
- World moved on anyway
- Some progressive evangelicals attempted to move with cultural change

**The Emerging Church**:
- Brought Gospel back into cultural conversation
- Created by progressive evangelicals
- Brent heard about it a lot but "never really understood what it meant" (on back end of that curve)
- When Marty was going into Bible college, "postmodernity was all the rage"
- By "rage" he means "evangelicalism was in a rage against postmodernity"
- Emerging Church was "den of iniquity and spawn of Satan himself"
- Largely rejected by Evangelicalism
- No longer considered viable approach

**Legacy of Emerging Church**:
- It's morphed and evolved into something new
- New day of Christian thought no longer about Emerging Church in original form
- But helped start conversations setting stage for growth church needed
- Prepared church for survival in coming world

### Today: Decentralized Everything
We find ourselves "at Today" (if you look at the timeline):

**Rise of**:
- Decentralized consumerism (Uber, Airbnb)
- Social networking
- Changed landscape of interaction everywhere

**The Questions**:
- "Hard to know exactly what lies just around the bend"
- "Where is God calling us, and what does any of this mean?"
- "Is there any hope at all for the future of Christianity?"
- "It seems like we have devolved into such a mess, that it's hard to know what God would even approve of in our efforts"

**Hope**:
> "Fear not listeners of BEMA. I believe we find ourselves—as every generation has—perfectly placed for this future and that's where we'll turn our attention in our next episode."

- Most of the Jewish-Christian scholarly collaboration happened after this
- Catholic scholarship was very present at the table
- Wonders how Vatican II and this interaction with Judaism are connected

## Practical Applications

### Learning from Both Streams
BEMA represents collision of:
- Academic scholarship and textual criticism
- Grassroots love for Jesus and Scripture
- Both are needed; neither sufficient alone

### Appreciating Our Roots While Growing Beyond
Marty models:
- Being deeply grateful for fundamentalist parents who taught him to love Jesus and Bible
- While deconstructing "a lot of everything else" about fundamentalism
- Honor the good, critically examine the problematic

### Avoiding Culture War Mentality
Modern evangelical culture wars are:
- At best: awkward puberty
- At worst: death throes
- Not the promised land OR final Armageddon
- We should think critically about this

### Asking Questions Judaism Can Answer
For 1800 years we didn't ask basic questions about Jewish context because:
- Too worried about doctrinal purity
- Too focused on theological rightness
- Didn't realize questions existed

Now we can engage Jewish scholarship to recover what was lost.

### Using Digital Tools Wisely
The internet:
- Speeds up distribution of discoveries (good and bad)
- Offers unprecedented access to knowledge
- Requires wisdom to navigate
- Democratizes learning in revolutionary ways

### Moving Beyond Emerging Church
While Emerging Church was largely rejected:
- It started important conversations
- Set stage for needed growth
- We can learn from its legacy without fully embracing it

### Embracing Our Historical Moment
Every generation is "perfectly placed for this future":
- We're not in wrong time
- God has prepared us for this moment
- Despite the mess, there's hope

## Study Questions

1. Marty says BEMA represents the collision of academic biblical scholarship with grassroots fundamentalist love for Scripture. Why did these streams separate? How do we hold them together?

2. Why were fundamentalism and theological liberalism both "equally bad options"? What happens when those are the only choices presented?

3. The culture wars are either "sociological puberty" or "death throes" of evangelicalism. Which do you think? What evidence supports your view?

4. Billy Graham and Bill Bright democratized evangelism. Was this entirely positive? What are potential downsides of making gospel presentation a simple formula?

5. For 1800 years, Christians didn't ask basic questions about Jewish context. Why not? What other questions might we not be asking because we don't realize they exist?

6. Jacob Neusner's work revolutionized biblical scholarship in the 1970s. Why did it take so long for Jewish and Christian scholars to collaborate?

7. Quantum science shook certainty about physical world just as postmodernity questioned absolute truth claims. How are these related? How should Christians respond?

8. The Emerging Church was "spawn of Satan" to many evangelicals but started important conversations. How do we assess movements that are largely rejected but contribute valuable insights?

9. Marty says we're "still in denial" about living in post-Christian culture. What would it look like to honestly accept this reality? How would it change our approach?

10. With internet speeding up information distribution, the 20-30 year gap from discovery to pulpit is shrinking. What are the opportunities and dangers of this?
