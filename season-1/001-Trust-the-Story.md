# BEMA Episode 001: Trust the Story

## Episode Overview

**Topic:** The Creation Story in Genesis 1
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Understanding Genesis 1 as foundational poetry that establishes human identity and worth rather than as a scientific explanation of creation mechanics

---

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### 1. **Genesis 1 as Poetry, Not Scientific Explanation**
Genesis 1 is structured as Hebrew poetry with intentional literary patterns. Its primary purpose is not to explain *how* creation happened scientifically, but to communicate deeper truths about *who* God is and *who* humans are.

### 2. **Human Identity and Worth**
The creation account was written for Israelites emerging from Egyptian slavery, where their value was tied to brick production. Genesis 1 teaches that humans possess **inherent worth beyond productivity**—they are valued for who they are, not what they produce.

### 3. **Rest as Resistance**
The Sabbath (Day 7) is central to understanding human dignity. Rest is not laziness but an act of trust in God and resistance against productivity-based identity. The seventh day uniquely lacks the phrase "evening and morning," inviting readers to enter God's ongoing rest.

### 4. **Shalom vs. Perfection**
Creation is described as "good" (Hebrew: *tov*), not "perfect." This distinction is crucial:
- **Perfect** (Greek concept): Static, unchangeable, complete
- **Good/Shalom** (Hebrew concept): Dynamic, loaded with potential, flourishing

## Important Theological Insights

### The Three Dimensions of God
The opening verses reveal God as:
1. **Creator** - "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"
2. **Spirit** - Hovering over the waters (like a Near Eastern dove in stationary flight)
3. **Word** - Speaking creation into being

### The Open-Ended Seventh Day
Day 7 is the only day without "evening and morning," suggesting:
- God's rest continues
- Humans are invited to participate in this ongoing rest
- The narrative is open-ended, requiring trust in God's story

### Starting with Genesis 1, Not Genesis 3
The episode emphasizes beginning the biblical narrative with Genesis 1's affirmation of **goodness** rather than jumping to Genesis 3's account of sin. This fundamentally changes how we understand humanity's place in creation—we start with dignity and belovedness, not brokenness.

### Freedom Redefined
True freedom is not about asserting rights or doing whatever we want. Freedom means **choosing what brings life** and participating in God's good creation.

## Hebrew Terms and Their Significance

| Hebrew Term | Meaning | Significance |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Elohim** | God | The divine creator |
| **Tohu va'vohu** | Chaotic nothingness, formless void | Describes the state before creation's ordering |
| **Ruach** | Spirit/wind/breath | God's Spirit hovering over creation |
| **Moadim** | Seasons/sacred times/festivals | Appears at the center of the chiastic structure, pointing to Sabbath and sacred rhythms |
| **Tov** | Good | Used repeatedly; "very good" appears only after humanity's creation |

---

## Literary Patterns Discussed

### 1. **Repetition**
- **"Evening and morning"** - Appears in reverse chronological order from typical Western phrasing
- **"It was good"** - Recurs throughout the account
- **"Very good"** - Appears only after humanity's creation

### 2. **Numerical Patterns**
- **Number 7**: Seven days of creation, 35 instances of "God" (7×5), various phrases appearing in multiples of 7
- **Number 3**: Recurs significantly throughout the text

### 3. **Chiastic Structure (Structural Mirroring)**
The creation week follows a pattern of **separation** (Days 1-3) and **filling** (Days 4-6):

| Separation (Days 1-3) | Filling (Days 4-6) |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Day 1: Light/darkness separated | Day 4: Sun, moon, stars fill the light/darkness |
| Day 2: Waters separated (sky/sea) | Day 5: Fish and birds fill waters and sky |
| Day 3: Land/seas separated | Day 6: Animals and humans fill the land |

**Central Point:** The word "moadim" (sacred times/festivals) appears at the chiasm's center, emphasizing rest and sacred rhythms.

## Practical Applications Mentioned

### 1. **Implementing Sabbath Rest**
- Rest is fundamental to recognizing human dignity
- Sabbath practice doesn't require specific Jewish observance but should be intentional
- Rest teaches us that our worth is unconditional, not performance-based

### 2. **Family Mantra**
Marty Solomon's family uses this mantra to teach children about unconditional worth:
> "We rest, we play, no work, God loves us"

### 3. **Critical Thinking About Teachers**
The hosts emphasize finding truth across various sources rather than categorizing teachers as "good" or "bad." They cite Rob Bell's influence while encouraging discernment.

### 4. **Trust in the Narrative**
Day 7's open ending invites readers to **trust God's story** rather than trying to control or complete it ourselves.

## Study Questions for Reflection

2. What does it mean that creation is "good" rather than "perfect"?
3. How does the chiastic structure emphasize the importance of Sabbath rest?
4. What does it look like to practice Sabbath as "resistance" in a productivity-driven culture?
5. How does starting with Genesis 1 (goodness) rather than Genesis 3 (sin) change your understanding of human identity?

## Summary

Genesis 1 is not primarily a scientific explanation of creation but a poetic account that establishes foundational truths about God and humanity. Through intentional literary patterns—repetition, numerical significance, and chiastic structure—the text emphasizes that humans possess inherent worth beyond productivity. The Sabbath (Day 7) stands at the center of this message, teaching that rest is not laziness but trust in God. By starting the biblical narrative with Genesis 1's affirmation of goodness rather than Genesis 3's account of sin, we fundamentally reframe our understanding of human identity: we are beloved image-bearers invited into God's ongoing rest.
