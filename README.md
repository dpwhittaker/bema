## History Book: How We Lost the Plot

Season 5's church history content has been synthesized into a book-format narrative exploring 2,000 years of Christian history thematically rather than chronologically.

**[View Table of Contents](history/TOC.md)**

The book traces how the early church lost its Jewish roots, its connection to the Text, its subversive community, its model of discipleship, and its culture of wrestling—and explores what hope exists for recovering these essential elements today.
