## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### Post-Crusades Christendom: Broken and Desperate
After the Crusades, Christendom emerged in "horrible shape":
- Completely beaten up and broken
- Having spent everything on war and conquest
- The crusades were largely unsuccessful by any measure
- Now facing the challenge of rebuilding
- Needing money desperately to restore what was destroyed

### The Age of Indulgences: When Money Bought Forgiveness
In a largely illiterate world where educated priests studied archaic foreign languages (Latin), it became easy to manipulate the truth. The narrative of God quickly became "something that can enslave people in a system of fear, guilt, and control."

**The Problem of the Sacraments**:
- People believed they interacted with church practices to experience God's grace, mercy, and forgiveness
- The seven sacraments (baptism, Eucharist, confession, marriage, etc.) served as conduits to receive God's grace
- For early thinkers, sacraments weren't magical - they were means of experiencing God's grace in daily life
- This wasn't about salvation but about experiencing God's ongoing grace

**The Corruption**:
- Church leadership began manipulating the sacrament system for their own ends
- At worst moments, the church offered forgiveness at a monetary price
- People were told to come to confession, go through motions, make a monetary offering
- This represented rapid abuse of church leadership and priesthood

**Important Distinction**: Marty clarifies that he's not using later Protestant Reformation language here - the sacraments weren't seen as ways to "get saved" but as ways to experience God's grace daily in life.

### The Remnant: Always Present
Even in the worst corruption, "there's always a remnant":
- At best: Priests maintaining sound doctrine, modeling self-sacrificial life, instilling hope
- These leaders were committed to the Gospel even when the system was corrupt
- Not everyone in church leadership was corrupt or self-serving

### Heroes of Pre-Reformation: Wycliffe and Hus

**John Wycliffe**:
- Consistently attacked the imperial privilege of the church
- Hated separation between clergy and laypeople, wanted the gap dissolved
- Argued against the "pomp of the height church system"
- Believed scripture shouldn't be held captive in an ancient language
- Wanted scriptures translated into common vernacular for people to understand
- Paved the way for the Reformation

**John Hus**:
- Sometimes called "a true father of the reformation"
- Hard to see Hus apart from Wycliffe's work
- Led informal resistance to the papacy
- Eventually executed for leading the Bohemian Revolt
- Led two successful regional crusades against the reigning papacy
- Used imperial methods (like a zealot) to fight the empire itself
- While methods may be questionable, laid groundwork for Protestant Reformation

### Medieval Nationalism: A Shifting World
The power structures of the world were changing entirely:
- **Medieval nationalism**: A new sense of national identity emerging
- No longer ruled by one giant papacy
- People aligned more with state and country than with foreign church
- People identified as "French Catholic" or "German Catholic" - nationality came first
- This made it easier to reject foreign papal rule
- Led to the Papacy of Avignon (shifting papal seat from Rome to France)
- Resulted in the Western Schism (Western Church split between western and eastern Europe)

### The Protestant Reformation
The church suffered from continuing divisions and schisms. In light of many abuses over religious power, the Reformation was "simply waiting for good leaders."

**Key Reformation Figures**:
- **Martin Luther** (German)
- **Ulrich Zwingli** (Swiss)
- **John Calvin** (French, though associated with Geneva)

Each led reformations in their respective lands, each with their own theological nuances.

### Denominational Splitting by Nation
No longer held together by papal leadership, Christians were free to disagree over smallest details, often fueled by nationalistic identifications:
- Germans → Lutheran
- French → Calvinistic reformers
- Swiss → Zwingli's followers
- Each national identity got a denominational affiliation

### The Printing Press Revolution
The invention of the printing press allowed:
- Widespread distribution of the text in common people's languages
- Wycliffe's commitment to translation being realized
- **Translation waves**: Wycliffe (Latin to English), Erasmus (assembled Greek), William Tyndale (Greek to English, lineage of King James), Luther (Latin to German)

**Impact on Education**:
- Reformed church changed face of education
- Significantly cinched up gap between educated and uneducated
- Both orthodoxy (right belief) and orthopraxy (right practice) became work of whole body
- "The ministry of all believers" - Luther's "priesthood of all believers"

## Historical Context and Key Events

### The Seven Sacraments
Gregory had created liturgy identifying seven sacraments as corporate practices for experiencing God's grace:
1. Baptism
2. Eucharist
3. Confession
4. Marriage
5. (Three others not specified in episode)

These served as ways for God's grace to flow into daily experience - both for salvation and for ongoing spiritual life.

### The Bohemian Revolt
Led by John Hus, this resistance movement:
- Fought against papal authority
- Led to Hus's execution
- Included two successful regional crusades against the papacy
- Demonstrated that resistance to papal authority was possible

### The Papacy of Avignon
- Shifted seat of papal power from Rome to France
- Seven popes ruled from Avignon
- Led to what would be called the Western Schism
- Western Church split between western and eastern Europe

### Translation Timeline
- **Wycliffe**: Translated from Latin to English (but working with Latin source)
- **Erasmus**: Early 1500s, assembled original language Greek texts
- **William Tyndale**: Translated from Erasmus's Greek into English (lineage of King James Bible)
- **Martin Luther**: Translated from Latin into German for German church

## Practical Applications

### Recognizing Systems of Control
The age of indulgences reminds us to watch for:
- Systems that use fear, guilt, and control rather than invitation
- Leaders who leverage spiritual authority for personal gain
- Any time money becomes prerequisite for experiencing God's grace

While we've moved past indulgences, Marty hints that we haven't fully escaped systems of fear, guilt, and control.

### The Power of Translation
Wycliffe and others believed everyone should access scripture in their own language. Today we should:
- Value Bible translation work (Wycliffe Translators carries on this legacy)
- Ensure people have access to understandable scripture
- Recognize that withholding scripture in accessible form is a tool of control

### Standing Against Corruption
Wycliffe and Hus model:
- Using privilege for self-sacrificial love rather than self-preservation
- Attacking corruption even when it's dangerous
- Dissolving gaps between clergy and laypeople
- Valuing the priesthood of all believers

### The Double-Edged Sword of Nationalism
Medieval nationalism had both positive and negative effects:
- **Positive**: Made it possible to reject corrupt foreign papal control
- **Negative**: Led to denominational splitting often driven by politics rather than theology
- **Today**: We should examine when national identity shapes our faith more than it should

### Appreciating the Printing Press
The printing press was as revolutionary then as the internet is today:
- Democratized access to information
- Enabled reformation movements
- Made education more accessible
- Today's digital tools offer similar opportunities - are we using them well?

## Study Questions

1. How did the system of indulgences corrupt the understanding of grace? Where do you see similar "pay to play" dynamics in modern Christianity?

2. Marty notes that even in the worst corruption, "there's always a remnant." Why is this important to remember? How does it give hope?

3. John Wycliffe and John Hus both fought against the separation between clergy and laypeople. Where does this separation still exist today? How can we dissolve it?

4. The Reformation leaders used different methods - Wycliffe focused on translation and teaching, Hus led revolts. How do we evaluate different approaches to fighting corruption and injustice?

5. Medieval nationalism both enabled the Reformation (allowing rejection of corrupt papal authority) and fragmented the church (denominational splitting by nation). How do we assess movements that have both positive and negative effects?

6. The printing press revolutionized access to scripture and knowledge. How is the internet doing the same today? What opportunities and dangers does this present?

7. Brent mentions that each denomination eventually had its own preferred translation. What are the benefits and drawbacks of this? How do modern multi-denominational translation efforts address this?

8. Marty says he's "super glad we grew out of this" (with obvious sarcasm) regarding fear, guilt, and control. Where do these dynamics still operate in modern Christianity?

## Notes on Western Context

Marty offers an important disclaimer: Session 5 follows a Western stream of church history, largely because that's his context and expertise. He acknowledges:
- He's speaking to mostly Western, American, Evangelical context
- Other streams of history exist and need their own telling
- He'd love for others to create their own podcasts/discussions for different contexts
- This is not comprehensive global church history
