Session 5 Intro

**Brent Billings:** This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon, I’m his co-host, Brent Billings. Welcome to the beginning of Session 5 and our journey through church history. Today we prepare for that trip by taking one last look in our rearview mirror.

**Marty Solomon:** I like it. Welcome to Session 5. We got a presentation—we do. Pull that up, we’ll help you follow along, real easy-like. Welcome to Session 5. Here’s what you need to know. First of all, we’re going to start off with the same recommendation we always start off every intro with—except for the intro to Session 1—which is if you have found this session and you have not listened to Sessions 1, 2, 3, or 4, we highly recommend doing so. Is that correct, Brent?

**Brent:** Yes. Maybe what’s more likely is you’ve probably jumped in with Romans and then you’ve just been going forward since then through Revelation, and you have no idea what’s going on.

[chuckles]

**Marty:** You think you do, but you’ve just missed all the good stuff. You’ve missed all the essential goodies.

**Brent:** The whole thing is established as a consistent narrative. We build on that from the very first episode. In fact, before the “first” episode, episode 0, we have our introduction.

**Marty:** It’s essential.

**Brent:** Everything is essential.

**Marty:** Here’s what I’m finding, Brent—now that we’re doing the Session 5 Intro, we can just come to grips with reality. I’ve been traveling around the country a lot, meeting a whole lot of our listeners. There’s a shocking amount—maybe it shouldn’t be shocking, I’m actually not shocked. It doesn’t quite hurt my heart, but so many—Session 2? Just “bloop.” [laughs] I would say about half the people I meet are like, “Yes, I didn’t listen to Session 2.”

**Brent:** Well, they get the guilt trip in Session 3, because Jesus quotes it all the time.

[laughs]

**Marty:** I tell them all the time, “It was a slog, but there are some real goodies in there.” Like two stories, one source, talking about the prophetic table, different voices in the Scripture. Man, woe to those who skipped Session 2. It was horrible.

[laughs]

**Brent:** I don’t know if that’s a good idea to say that.

**Marty:** Maybe not. Hey, if you stumbled into Session 5, and you’re missing any of the previous sessions, you need to go get those. Stop what you’re doing. It’d be like taking a—that’s not going to work. Here I was going to say “a 400-level class,” but that’s not going to be what this is. [chuckles] It’s not going to be what Session 5 is.

**Brent:** Imagine watching a movie and you only watch the last 20 minutes.

**Marty:** That’s right—don’t do that.

**Brent:** You don’t know anything about any of the characters, you don’t know the world that’s been established.

**Marty:** That’s right. Alright, here’s the deal. Session 5 is going to take us on this journey through church history. We’re going to try to answer the question, where are we today and how did we get here. There’s a whole lot of space in between where Revelation ended and where I sit now, and 20 whatever year it is that you’re listening to this in America or wherever, there’s an awful lot of stuff that happened. We’re going to try to take a look at that and try to understand how we got here. At the end, we’re going to take the opportunity to sum up the big ideas of the body of work and inspire us to walk it out together.

Excited about that. Before I jump into that last look in the rearview mirror that you spoke of, Brent, maybe there’s a couple of things right upfront. First of all, just the plea, the ask. We’re looking for financial partners, we’re still looking for financial partners. We had an unbelievable response to the intentional asks we made months ago, but we still have a need, and that support came in as a rush and it has dipped significantly.

We’re trying to figure out what kind of income we can count on and we need your support. We need you to click on that donate link that’s in your show notes. If our work has been meaningful to you, if you’ve made it all the way to Session 5, if you didn’t skip Session 2, you’ve been on a long journey with us. If that work has made a difference to you and you can spare $8 a month, $10 a month, if you can spare $50 a month, $100 a month, you guys are making a huge difference for us, these regular givers.

Even $10 a month givers, if we have 100 of those $10 a month givers, that’s a significant amount of monthly income. Don’t underestimate what your small gift could do. I know a lot of our listeners are in places in their life, younger demographic college students loaded up with debt, I know that. If there’s some little bit that you can give and contribute, it’s going to really help us. We have some big plans, we have some big dreams. I know that I do. Some of them I haven’t even shared, they’re so big.

If we can have the support, if the financial support is there, we can do some really cool things with what we’re doing here at BEMA. We’ll leave that up to God through you. We’d love for you to respond. Just go to that donate link, find a ministry team, click on I want to give to ministry teams.

**Brent:** I think the link actually takes you straight to ministry team.

**Marty:** Straight there? That’d be even more beautiful. Just go there and set up a gift to BEMA Ministry, setting up a recurring gift is just the best blessing to us. There’s other places you can give too. You’re welcome to give to the general fund; it’s really hard to raise money for the general fund because it’s the unsexy work. Administrative overhead, who wants to give to that? Gross. Some of you are business owners and you understand administrative overhead. You understand what that is and what it takes to run an organization, even a non-profit.

If that’s where your heart’s at, feel free to give to that. There’s always the Solomon account. If you were to dig in there far enough, you’d get to the personal staff pages and you could support the Solomon family. As I record this, a few weeks ago, we lost one of our largest donors. It’s put a big dent in our income stream for our personal ministry account. There’s always other places where you can give with your heart—just really if God pulls you in that direction.

We appreciate support in each and every form that you choose to give it. It’s awesome. Thank you, guys. All you listeners that have started giving, you have created a whole new world, literally a whole new world for Brent Billings. Been a different world, Brent?

**Brent:** Yes, absolutely.

**Marty:** Absolutely. Since January of 2020.

**Brent:** I was already doing a lot of BEMA stuff on the side, now that it is not on the side, I don’t have other work and it’s been great. I’ve been able to put a lot more study and preparation into the podcast and hopefully so much more going forward as well.

**Marty:** Yes. I hope it’s been good for your overall self and well-being.

**Brent:** Yes, definitely. [chuckles]

**Marty:** Good. Let’s see. There we go. Making a difference left and right. We have other things, Brent. We have a Messenger newsletter they can sign up for. We got a map with groups on it. You can find a group, you can sign your group up. If your group’s not on the map, let us know about it. We’ll put it on the map. If the map isn’t accurate, if you go there and you’re like, Oh, hey, that’s not where my group is, let us know, help us keep the map up-to-date. Brent, you like to talk about iTunes reviews, that kind of stuff?

**Brent:** Yes, leave us a review on iTunes or Apple Podcasts or recommend us in Overcast or wherever you listen. It helps people find the show.

**Marty:** Yes, all this stuff can be found on the website. Just go to bemadiscipleship.com, spend some time if you have ten minutes, look around the website. We got everything from the Slack workspace sign-ups to—in the future, as we have trips, you’re going to see trips there. You’re going to see if I’m traveling, if I have an upcoming event, if we’re hosting a weekend event.

All that stuff is on the News tab. We even put upcoming Jewish holidays so people can learn more about Jewish holidays. The Solomon family is observing Jewish holidays. Everything can be found there. Head there and check it out, you’ll enjoy what you see. Anything else, Brent, before we dive into the short review?

**Brent:** No. Let’s do it.

**Marty:** Let’s do it. Alright.

**Brent:** Let’s you do it.

**Marty:** Alright. [laughs] We wore ourselves out in the last episode there on the Capstone of Session 4.

**Brent:** Last episode was building the entire house. This episode is just putting up the framework.

**Marty:** Just the framework. We’re just going to skip a rock across this thing. We take all the major chunks of the Scripture, we give it one short little synopsis, a word or two, or a phrase. Then, if you’re looking at your presentation there, you’ll have just some concepts that are broken down. First section, we’re going to have Torah. Torah, the word for Torah, that we have is the idea of partnership. Everything about Torah, everything about the Books of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy—is about partnership.

Genesis about the basis of the partnership, the big ideas, meeting the characters that are involved in this partnership. Exodus is the part where God formally chooses that partner, and the partner chooses God. There’s a marriage there. Leviticus is God defining the partnership. It’s the definition, “what is the partnership going to look like?” In Numbers, God shapes his partner, God takes the partner out to the desert and shapes and molds that partner into what he wants her to be. Then God asks his partner to remember everything that the partnership was built upon. That was the book of Deuteronomy.

The second slide you have there is the next section, which we call history. We say, history can be summed up in the idea of God’s redemption cycle, and God’s patience. Redemption cycle and God’s patience. We see it in Joshua when God takes his people and he puts them in the middle of the action, the crossroads of the earth. We see it in Judges and in Ruth when God’s people struggle to walk the path of God and trust the story. Some do and some don’t and there’s struggle and there’s victory and there’s failure and there’s success.

We see it in Samuel and Kings, as God’s people struggle with identity and obedience to be people of integrity and morality. We also see it through the lens of Chronicles where God’s people struggle with empire and becoming the anti-story and injustice starts to take root and take hold. Injustice is the product of a people that have lost the plot of the story and they forget to bless all nations and they just try to bless self.

In the midst of that struggle, the next slide there, we have the wisdom literature, the wisdom section. In the midst of that struggle, God gave us tools. If we’re going to survive this struggle, and this struggle isn’t just negative. It’s not just struggle. It’s not just the slog. It’s got highs and lows and everything in between, but if we’re going to make it through that well, we’re going to need tools. We’re going to need art and song for worship and expression. We’re going to need to be able to connect on something other than just a head level, and so we have the Psalms. We’re going to need nuggets of conventional wisdom, so we have the Proverbs. We’re going to need purpose and reason to get up every morning, is the book of Ecclesiastes. We’re going to need relationships and intimacy. If we’re going to survive, Song of Songs.

From there, we move over to the prophets. We have warning, woes, and hope. Warning, woes, and hope. We had God sending warning in pre-Assyrian or pre-Babylonian prophets. Prophets like Amos, Hosea, Micah, First Isaiah, Zephaniah, Second Isaiah. We had God pronouncing woe and judgment through prophets like Jonah or Nahum, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Habakkuk, Obadiah, Joel.

Then God gives hope and encouragement to an exiled people. When you sit in exile, God sends prophets not to condemn you more, but to give you hope and to strengthen you. Prophets like Ezekiel and Daniel and Job, and Third Isaiah. Eventually, Cyrus shows up. Cyrus the Great, the Persian. He tells God’s people that they can go home. Some do, and some don’t, but it lets us into the period of history that we call the remnant. We summed up the remnant with the words returning, yearning and learning. Returning, yearning, and learning.

First of all, God’s people return. They return to rebuild and restore what once was. You can see that in books like Fourth Isaiah, Ezra, and Nehemiah. You see God’s people yearn for what used to be. You can see that in prophets like Haggai or Zechariah. You can see God’s people learn. There’s returning and there’s yearning, but then there’s learning. God’s people learn that this new world demands a new approach. You could find that in books like Malachi or Esther.

That, of course, led us to the end of Tanakh, the end of Session 2, and we walked right into the silent years, which weren’t really silent at all. They’re called silent because they’re not in your Bible. At least not without the Deuterocanonical sections. Not in most of our Christian Bibles, but they were far from silent. A lot of stuff goes on in this period of history, and we sum that up by talking about synagogue and Hellenism. Synagogue: it demonstrated a return to the Text, a passionate return, a new education system, a devotion to becoming people of the Scriptures. By the time Jesus shows up on the scene, that is going to have to have found its way through a whole new cultural context, a cultural setting, a cultural stage of Hellenism.

Hellenism was this idea that man was the measure of all things. It upended the value system of the world and of culture. It was no longer about appeasing the gods. It was now more about appeasing self. That, at least at times, runs counter to the biblical narrative. The biblical narrative of self-sacrifice, Hellenism was very much a narrative of self-preservation. It was Empire, it was not Shalom, and so you had different responses. How do you respond to that? Well, you had the Sadducees, the Herodians, the Essenes, the Pharisees, and the Zealots.

The Sadducees—they had this corrupt partnership, although they were called by God. The Herodians had this compromising idolatry, even though they were perfectly placed for God’s mission. The Essenes had an absolute devotion, a commitment to the Text, but they were isolated. The Pharisees had an absolute devotion to obedience, to walking out the Text; in the midst of that commitment to righteousness, at least their idea of righteousness, they lost compassion.

The Zealots had zeal; they would actually be the one group that would go do something physically, get involved and get something done. The problem was as they always used imperial means to do so, they used the same weapons that Rome would use to get the job done. That led us to the Gospels, which we said was the story in flesh. We had Torah. Let’s review up to this point. Brent—Torah, what was the word?

**Brent:** Partnership.

**Marty:** How about—what was history?

**Brent:** Redemption cycle and God’s patience.

**Marty:** Excellent. Wisdom?

**Brent:** Tools.

**Marty:** Prophets?

**Brent:** Warning, woes, and hope.

**Marty:** Remnant?

**Brent:** Returning, yearning, and learning.

**Marty:** Absolutely, and silent years?

**Brent:** The ideas of synagogue and Hellenism.

**Marty:** Excellent. Gospels brings us to the story in flesh. Everything that we just talked about ends up being incarnated. Jesus takes the whole Tanakh, the whole story, the whole narrative, and he wraps it in flesh. The narrative, the story comes and walks among us. The proper interpretation, the proper fulfillment, but the story itself takes on that human form in the person of the Christ. You had these four versions of that story. The story in flesh. Four people, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John talked about the story in flesh.

Matthew said the one thing that he picked up when he saw the story in flesh was that God was committed to the mumzer/mamzer. That was his agenda. He wanted everybody to know, “When I saw the story in flesh, what I saw was a God who cared about the mumzer.” Mark wrote to a Roman world, and he said, “When I saw the story in flesh, what I saw was everything that Rome needs to hear.” Luke said, “I saw the story in flesh and I wanted to give you the story right alongside the story that we read every week.” He writes this ordered parashah companion.

John says, “When I saw the story in flesh, I saw a story that was unbelievably relevant for a Greco-Asian, Greco-Roman world that we ended up living in with Jew and Gentile together. This grafted story. I saw the story in flesh.” That led us to the book of Acts, because what happens when the story takes on flesh, Jesus comes and walks among us. The Christ is here, the Christ has died, the Christ is buried, the Christ is risen and resurrected and leaves behind this Holy Spirit in a new, special way.

We get the book of Acts which we called the epilogue of an early church. This is what happens when the kingdom of empire meets the Kingdom of God empowered by the Holy Spirit. What happens is the people of God remember their call to be a blessing to all nations. What happens is you end up having this very Jewish church in a very Gentile context. That’s what you’re seeing in the book of Acts. Then what are the rest of the letters? The rest of the letters, the early church as we’ll call it, the early church, we’re going to call that text to context.

First you’re going to have Paul’s letters, and Paul is going to apply the way of Jesus to each unique context and setting. What does Jesus look like in Philippi? What does Jesus look like in Ephesus? What does Jesus look like in Corinth? What does Jesus look like in Thessalonica? What does Jesus look like for Titus or for Timothy? That’s what Paul’s doing. Then the letter of Hebrews is instructing these Hebrew believers to persevere in the face of a destroyed temple. Jesus has a better way. There are other writers in the early church, people like James.

James says doing the mitzvot with a purpose, guarding your tongue. Not just doing the mitzvot to be saved or be justified. Not just doing the mitzvot for mitzvot purposes, but understand: the mitzvot is what makes faith alive and real for his Jewish reader. For a Jew to obey Torah, to have walked in its way is the way that God is going to use them to impact the world. After that, you had authors like Peter and John and Jude. Peter who wanted to talk about holy living as God’s chosen people. John wanted to talk about how loving others is the truth.

That’s what it is. Then Jude, he wanted to use the apocryphal to exalt God’s people, to call them to a better walk, to a better way, and he wanted to use their own mid rush to get that job done. Then we finally had Revelation and using the past, using Tanakh, using the text to illuminate the present. Using text to illuminate the context, using text to context, using the past words. The past apocalyptic literature, the past experiences, the past story to illuminate their present experience. That’s a short review.

It’s a much quicker little journey when we do it that way, but a little bit more concise and maybe a little bit easier to like, “Oh yes, I see the long review is like the guts. It’s like spending time to be like, “Okay, but do I understand Leviticus? Do I understand 2 Samuel? Do I understand Jonah?” The short review is like, “If I back up far enough, do I see the big picture?” I always love putting this on a whiteboard. I’m a big whiteboard guy. You know this about me, Brent?

**Brent:** Right.

**Marty:** Love to take these reviews—long review and short review—and just put it all on a big old whiteboard so I can just see the story, I can see the arc, I can see the movement, I can see—or putting these on unique slides, each one having its own unique slide. I love to be able to do this on a whiteboard. I encourage you, if you are a whiteboard person—if you want to see the big picture, find a big thing, a butcher paper, a whiteboard, and just put this whole thing out there on a big old timeline and see how it looks.

**Brent:** If you do that, send us a picture of it.

**Marty:** Yes, where is Roger? Roger’s been making that big ol’ timeline for us.

**Brent:** I am sure we will hear from him.

**Marty:** Absolutely, especially now. I don’t know what he will do at Session 5 in church history. Wooh. I would love to see Rogers Schmidgall. I think I said his name right this time. He did that great timeline for us? Maybe he will give us an updated version. You can drop it in there.

**Brent:** Sounds good.

**Marty:** Alright. We are ready for Session 5, Brent.

**Brent:** Alright. If you have any questions for the show, go to bemadiscipleship.com. You can find Marty on Twitter at @martysolomon and I’m at @eibcb. That’s a great way to send us a picture of your butcher paper, whiteboard, or whatever. Thanks for joining us on The BEMA Podcast. We will talk to you again soon.
