AD 1550–1650

**Brent Billings:** This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon. I’m his co-host, Brent Billings. Today we walk through one century of history that had an unbelievable amount of change and progress. Even outside of Church history, this evolving world was fertile soil for the Reformation.

**Marty Solomon:** Absolutely. This is, like we said, just one century worth of discussion today, and yet we’ll end up having two slides for you. Two timeline slides for you. We’re picking up the back end of one and the very beginning of the next, talking 1550–1650. It’s a little weird chunk, but when I originally broke up my material, this was the chunk I wanted. There was just so much stuff that happened in these 100 years that I want to talk about. You do have some visuals. You do have some pictures; so go find those.

**Brent:** This stuff does bleed together a little bit depending on what part of the world you’re talking about, or whatever. We talked about some of the stuff that applies to this period of history in our last episode, and I’m sure we’ll have some cross-conversation in future episodes as well.

**Marty:** Yes, it’s really hard to break this stuff up.

**Brent:** Fuzzy boundaries.

**Marty:** Reality does not fit into nice clean categories with breaks like we want it to.

**Brent:** Especially like we want it to, the two of us specifically. [laughs]

**Marty:** Alright, let’s see here. When I first studied Church history, the Reformation, that period of Church history. When you think of Church history, it’s the Reformation—for anybody who’s Protestant, that’s it.

**Brent:** There was no Church before that effectively.

**Marty:** [laughs] That period of history was taught as an unbelievable time of change—and for obvious reasons, this period of history was seen as the hinge point for the modern era. That’s where the world really started moving towards the era that we know as modernity and the modern era. It was one of the major peaks of the history of Christendom. I was just like, “It was the Reformation. It was the all-star moment of Church history.”

I know it feels like I’m setting up a “but” statement, [chuckles] but I actually agree with those statements. I’ve come to see those statements that were made, those implications, when I was learning Church history. I’ve even come to see those truths from a bigger and a wider angle than what I believe was even being taught to me.

Originally, I picked up on this period of Church history. It was taught to me through the light of the progression of Protestant Christian development. I mentioned this before in an earlier episode—we’re definitely following a particular track through Christian history. At this point, we’re going to follow the Protestant Reformation. Protestantism, we’re going to start to follow that track and we’re not going to follow the history of Catholicism.

I know we have some Catholic listeners, and that’s not done to slight anybody. It’s just because I’m not as familiar with those periods of history. You need to put together your own podcast and take us through your little wave of Church history, if you will. The Reformation was definitely taught me through that lens of Protestant Christian thought development. This development, this Protestant Christian development did not just happen in a vacuum.

In fact, this period of Christendom was accompanied by an unbelievably tumultuous time of cultural change that immediately followed it. Without the Reformation, I don’t believe Christianity would have survived the 200 years after it. I’m going to say that again. Without the Reformation, I don’t believe Christianity would have survived the 200 years that came after it. That statement has very little to do with what most of us would call theology or Church ecclesiology. Ecclesiology, Brent, what does that word mean?

**Brent:** I was just going to ask you.

**Marty:** [laughs] I figured you were. Yes, ecclesiology—that it is the study of the Church. Theology is the study of God, theos. Ecclesio—ecclesia—ecclesiology is the study of a Church. When I talk about the Reformation—like, the Reformation didn’t happen in a vacuum. This whole period of time, the Church would not have survived what was going to happen in the world for the next 200 years, had they not gone through the Reformation.

I’m not necessarily talking about the theology or just what happened in the Church. I’m talking about something much bigger than that. Even as I say that, I wonder if we can even separate those two worlds. Like Church history and non-Church history. Can you even talk about Church history and secular history at this point in the conversation? I don’t know. It is incredibly difficult to imagine a pre-French Revolution world. We live in a very post-French Revolution world.

If you’re like, “What does the French Revolution have to do with this?” We haven’t talked about that yet. That’s coming up in the next episode or so. We’ll get there next, but it’s hard for us to imagine a world in which there’s no separation in thought between Church and state, and you referenced that in your quote, an episode or two maybe ago, Brent, when you quoted out of our Bruce Shelley text, that distinction between Church and state.

Without that distinction between Church and state, but without a distinction between faith and science, at this point. Between poetry and pragmatism. That’s a part of our consciousness. It is really hard for us to be able to step outside of our own awareness and consciousness of how we experience the world and try to imagine a world in any other space.

I suppose one might be able to make the case as in like the James Hannam book that we mentioned in an earlier episode. Somebody could make the case that the Reformation actually led to and or catalyzed, what we refer to as the Age of Enlightenment. In a lot of ways, this whole period of history catalyzed what we would refer to as the Age of Enlightenment.

[music]

**Marty:** To work through this, in the late 16th century, we were handed two people in history who had a super large impact on Christianity. John Knox, is known as the man who founded the Presbyterian Church. It’s a pretty big part of the Christian stream of Protestantism, Presbyterians. I grew up in a reformed tradition. I’m very familiar with the Presbyterians. John Knox happened to be—Presbyterianism, I should say, happened to be the flavor of reformation in Scotland. We talked about it before, Brent. How did the Reformation work in different countries in Europe? Like did you have multiple Churches to choose from reformation-wise, or how did that work?

**Brent:** Not exactly. Earlier on, it was limited to what nation you were a part of.

**Marty:** Right. If you were German, you were probably what? Lutheran. That was the case here with Presbyterians. If you were a Protestant and you were in Scotland, you were more than likely a Presbyterian. That worldview was seemingly overthrowing the presence of Catholicism and even Anglicanism there. Presbyterianism was on the rise.

While those from a Presbyterian background would probably appreciate a much larger treatment of Knox’s contributions, I would, (A) be totally ill-equipped to do that, and (B) if I were to talk about it, I would simplify it into the style of government the Presbyterian Church is named after. Unlike other movements in the Protestant era, Knox brought an approach to Church polity and governments known as the Presbytery. The presbytery, I was raised on the wisdom and the beauty of the Presbytery, my Church leadership taught me.

A Presbytery is a group of representatives who would lead the Church as a governing body rather than a hierarchy of papacy, priesthood, or any of those kinds of ideas. Instead of a hierarchy of working your way down the pyramid, you have a presbytery, a group of representatives. This whole idea really came from John Knox and his understanding of the world and what he contributed to the conversation.

In reference to all that idea we just talked about there, it’s hard to quantify the effect that this whole idea would have on the thinking that would eventually lead to a political style of governance based on democratic. Like in our world of a Democratic Republic, like the work of John Knox. When I thought of John Knox, can you remember studying John Knox when you went through school, Brent?

**Brent:** No.

**Marty:** Oh, man. I could and it could just be a horrible memory of mine, but John Knox was taught to me in public school growing up as much more of a political figure. When I started reading about him in reference to Church history, I was totally confused, but learning the whole context made complete sense.

**Brent:** I recently ran across some information on Mary, Queen of Scots, who was the monarch figure during this period of history. I haven’t really studied much about Knox himself.

**Marty:** Yes, sure. Yes, and he just had a huge effect on what we would know as parts of the system of our government today.

**Brent:** I guess maybe I should point out, if you’re unfamiliar with the period of history, the United Kingdom does not exist at this point. England is separate from Scotland.

**Marty:** Sure. Right.

**Brent:** They have a lot of conflicts going on here.

**Marty:** Absolutely. Yes, that’s a good context. While many of these ideas that we’re talking about are based on Roman systems of government, when we think about the government of America and the principles that we’ve based upon, are definitely based on Roman systems of governance going all the way back to Caesar and that whole system. The impact of John Knox on the application of that representative leadership is undeniable. Obviously, driving a lot of the whole democratic thought and the Democratic Party and those kinds of things based on a lot of his ideas.

**Brent:** The Roman Senate was not representative of the people the way the US Senate is representative.

**Marty:** Correct. Absolutely. It’s been shaped by some of these ideals. It’s based on some of the same ideas and yet applied very differently in some ways. Another name in the mix during the Age of Enlightenment, is one of my favorite characters in this conversation, Nicolaus Copernicus. Good old Copernicus.

He had this crazy idea, a crazy idea that our universe was not revolving around the earth. He proposed the idea of a universe revolving around the sun. Using his expertise in science and mathematics, Copernicus was just trying to be honest about the things that he was discovering.

Now, again, I want to remind everybody, I am not a scientist nor a true historian. I am way out of my league, and yet here we go. [chuckles] While most of us read this portion of history with a smirk thinking about Copernicus and how he was so right, and the world around him thought he was so crazy. We often fail to realize in the same conversation, the impact that this had on the world of theology. I never appreciated it until I studied this. The impact that Copernicus had on theology.

In this period of history, the Church’s theology rested on a geocentric understanding of the universe. You know, Brent, I think there’s a Wikipedia article on this and I really like the picture that’s on that. Let’s link the Wikipedia article because I love the visuals that the article has to help people understand the implications of this whole discussion theologically.

In fact, if you go to that Wikipedia article, the picture that sits there actually shows you a visual representation of that model. When you look at that photo there, that picture, it shows you how their understanding of science was completely linked to their understanding of theology. It’s just a great visual here, so let me not get too far away from my notes.

Using the idea that the earth is the center of the universe, the theology of “the heavens” was such that differing levels of “the heavens” and ultimately God’s dwelling place could be found at the further levels of these concentric circles of universal existence.

While most of us would see this as a simple scientific adjustment and part of the learning process, the Church in that day did not. The prominent belief was that the proposal of Copernicus and what we call heliocentrism, I think there might be a Wikipedia article for that. Heliocentrism. That’s versus and against geocentrism. The idea that the earth is at the center.

Now we have Heliocentrism, which is what our understanding is basically today on some basic level. The proposal of Copernicus and what we call heliocentric ideas, in the theological mind, was threatening the very existence of God himself. His teaching was deemed by many to be heretical and an attack on the teachings of the Church. How dare Copernicus teach something through the realm of science that contradicted what we understood in the world of theology?

I just want to pause here as a side note. I hope our listeners are realizing the relevance of this conversation to our own century of Church history. I’m getting ahead of myself, but it’s worth a pause right now. We need to be catching this. It’s the world we live in today. It’s a world where new scientific understandings threaten our understanding of theology and the Bible. Instead of jumping to hasty conclusions, we may want to take a lesson from this chapter of history because—spoiler alert: Copernicus was right. [chuckles]

If we don’t learn from these lessons of history, the next few centuries may not look back on our day with much kindness, but might see us as incredibly foolish just as we do the 16th century. I digress, we will cross that bridge in time when we get to that conversation. I hope, if we just pause here now, Brent, if we were to go all the way back, I still today deal with emails from people just getting into—you remember Session 1, Brent? Do you remember all the way back in Session 1?

**Brent:** Barely.

**Marty:** [chuckles] 2016, and we’re very intentionally and very gently trying to suggest that there’s more going on in Genesis, that it’s not a scientific lab report. That maybe there are chiasms and larger points to the story. We’re trying to give us some breathing room and some elbow room so that we could read our science textbook on one half of our desk and our Bible on the other and not feel like they’re in competition. All the emails that you get when people start to go through that journey and they’re like, “Well, wait a minute, are you saying that Noah happened or it didn’t happen?”

Hopefully, now we can look back on that time and that awkward phase and understand why that was so important. Hopefully, we handled that well. Hopefully, we were gentle and just brought you along for the ride because this is why. Right now we’re looking at Church history. This is why it’s so important that we went on that journey together. Because if we don’t do that, we make some really critical mistakes with theology.

It’s probably not a shocker to most of our listeners. Science will not backtrack and affirm the status quo of the Church, quite the opposite. In fact, Galileo was one scientific giant, who would champion the cause of Copernicus and through his use of telescopes and other kinds of mathematics, which I am not an expert. Galileo would prove in many ways, not just one, the validity of a heliocentric universe.

While this incredibly uncomfortable growth in the Church took more than a century, it happened nonetheless. The Church was not going to stop us discovering and learning all about new truth. Shocker, believe it or not. What ended up happening? The Church accepted, albeit quietly and very politically and shuffling the cards, but they accepted that their thinking was flawed. They made adjustments. The Church did. The Church as a whole made adjustments to their theology, albeit it not gracefully [chuckles] and the Church moved on. That’s how Church history works.

There’s one more thinker I want to talk about before we’re done here today. His name is Blaise Pascal. Blaise Pascal, a Christian philosopher, who helped make some radical advances in science and mathematics. In a lot of ways, Pascal would set the stage for what we understand as Newtonian Physics. Through the work of men like this, because they’re like, “What does it have to do with Church history man? Why keep talking about science?”

Because through the work of men like Newton, like Pascal, the Church was able to move even if it was an awkward movement through the Age of Enlightenment. This growth curve would not end anytime soon in their growth curve. It would be this long grueling, arduous work. The hard work of Christian evolution through this era is only the beginning. In many ways, we are still in the awkward growth phase of this era.

To this day, we continue to have a hard time appreciating the world of faith and science. We often see those two worlds as enemies. We have never truly recovered from the adversarial tone that was struck during the Age of Enlightenment. We have made some huge advances, so we’re not still stuck in the same conversation but we still have this lingering adversarial—science is always out to get faith in the understanding of the world.

**Brent:** Pascal, where is he from? What tradition was he a part of at the time?

**Marty:** My history could be a tad bit rusty here. Brent, you can pull up his Wikipedia page. Let’s give us some summary of who Blaise Pascal is. Tell us who…

**Brent:** Says he’s a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and Catholic theologian. That is what my next question is—so he’s a Catholic theologian?

**Marty:** Some great points coming up here and that one century actually brought up some great things, Brent. First of all, he’s French. Notice how much France and French thinking is going to shape the next 100 to 200 years. It’s going to be a huge—I just was never taught this. They’re going to be huge thinkers and shapers of this part of history. Second, you pointed it out. He’s not Protestant, he’s actually Catholic. When we talk about math and science and we’re not talking about it in this series, but things like art or music, Catholicism really owns those things. When I mention, I’m so glad you brought this up, Brent. Unintentionally, so wonderful. When I mentioned that the reformation set the stage for the change in the world and the change in the world, combined with reformation allowed the Church to survive, those things were interlinked and interlocked.

They weren’t separate and they played off of each other. Because the reformation was driving, really pushing against Catholicism in a lot of ways, the whole world was kind of like—I don’t know if it’s a good metaphor, but going through this awkward stage of pubescent Church growth. It’s like this awkward, “We’ve clung to one kind of Christendom, but now there’s this whole Age of Enlightenment.” The results of scholasticism.

This Protestant and Catholic train are kind of moving together and Catholicism was undoubtedly, no Catholic I don’t think would argue with this, was undoubtedly pulled forward because of the challenge. The positive challenge and critique of the Protestant reformation. All this thinking is moving forward. Some of them are Protestant thinkers. Some of them are Catholic thinkers.

I think I’m going to say, most to them if you study the history of science—forget the Church history for now. If you study this history of science, if you study the history of mathematics, many of those thinkers are going to be Catholic, because they had some of the best education, some of the best systems of scholasticism. While they’re being challenged on two levels, on a theological level and they’re being challenged very much so on an ecclesiological level, everything else in the world is pulling the Church conversation forward.

Maybe that’s even a critical moment in Church history, because the Church used to pull—prior to this, going 400 years back, it felt like the Church conversation was pulling history forward. Did you feel like that when you listened to it, Brent, when we talked? Even in the dark chapters like the crusades, it felt like Church history was kind of pulling the world forward, right?

**Brent:** Yes. It was also mixed up, but the Church was kind of even running the political side of things.

**Marty:** Right. It was kind of driving the truck. Then, scholasticism, through the Church, somehow shifts into the driver’s seat. This might be an overstatement, but ever since then, the Church has been trailing behind trying to catch up, being pulled forward by the rest of that conversation. That’s probably something to be on some level grieved, mourned, maybe even just think critically about.

What are the implications when the Church starts lagging behind and we’re always kind of at war with this driving movement, the growth of culture? What was the difference when, for better or for worse, the Church was out in front driving culture? What was Judaism doing in the 1st Century? What was Israel and Judah doing back in Session 2? What is it like when it’s switched and what do we need to do about it? Great discussion fodder for your groups, if you’ve got groups meeting for this conversation. Have any other thoughts there on Blaise? You’re looking as if you might.

**Brent:** Well, yes. Sorry, I didn’t realize he was Catholic. That kind of leads into the other thought I had. How much—on the Protestant side of things, I think France was mostly in the Calvin—the Huguenots were the French Calvinists, essentially. I didn’t realize that John Calvin was French, but apparently, that’s where he’s from. We don’t really have the concept of denominations at this point. We’re starting to separate from the Catholic Church in a few ways, but it’s usually separated by nation. I’m just wondering, Pascal, being a Catholic guy in France, how much influence is he having in his time with other nations, other Protestant denominations, for lack of a better word?

**Marty:** Yes. That’s a good question. I’m going to state this very loosely and not heavy-handedly because I’m just not as much of an expert here. My understanding, part of the reason we don’t associate Calvin often with a French locale or origin, is because he kind of bounced all over the place. Calvin spent one of the most well-known portions of his history in Geneva.

**Brent:** Yes. He was pushed out of France.

**Marty:** Exactly. That was actually where I was driving was this idea of—Protestantism did not thrive. France was not one of the places where it had its easiest go. There are some national geographical locations that were more fertile for the movement of the Reformation. Even going back to, we talked about the French Pope for those centuries, Avignon, who the schism of the Western Church, there’s a real Catholicism stronghold through a very—Protestantism is going to be a challenge for them in France. It’s going to play a large part leading up all the way up to the French Revolution, for sure. It’s a great question and a great observation to point out. Yes.

**Brent:** Something for further study, certainly.

**Marty:** Absolutely.

**Brent:** Well, I think that’s all we have to offer for this episode.

**Marty:** I like it. That was good.

**Brent:** If you have any questions, you can go to bemadiscipleship.com You can get in touch with us there. You can find groups around the world. Get a group, if you’re not in one. If you’ve made it this far and you’re not in a group, that’s kind of incredible. Yes, and maybe it’s time to find a group and start back at the beginning and work through it with a community of people. It’s a great way to move forward.

**Marty:** Absolutely. A lot of people do that.

**Brent:** Well, thanks for joining us on the BEMA Podcast. We’ll talk to you again soon.
