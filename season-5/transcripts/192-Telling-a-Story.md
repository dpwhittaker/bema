Telling a Story

**Brent Billings:** This is the BEMA Podcast with Marty Solomon. I’m his co-host, Brent Billings. Today we discuss what history is, what it isn’t, and give some disclaimers about our intentions with Session 5.

**Marty Solomon:** Yes. It’s going to be a short little conversation today, but important for me and—I might be speaking personally, the listeners might not even care—but this is an important disclaimer episode for me. We left our last conversation on our last episode before our intro and our capstone to Session 4, that last content episode of Revelation in Session 4, we left that conversation finishing our study of the scriptures and had this nagging question, “What happened between Revelation and where I sit today?” Now that we’re done with our study of the God-breathed Text we are entering a very sticky and dangerous realm of my own personal thoughts and opinions.

I like it a lot better when I can just talk about the scripture and talk about what the rabbis taught and lean on other people’s authority. Now we’re going to talk about history and that’s different. While my thoughts and opinions have certainly been at work in the previous discussions that we’ve had all throughout the study of the scriptures in almost 200 episodes, I have taken solace in the fact that we were working on a discussion centered around the life-giving biblical narrative.

But this question is incredibly important, this, “What happened?” question. As a Bible teacher who works with college students, I’m deeply convicted that if we don’t wrestle with these questions we have done a huge disservice to our study of the Text. One of the things we talk about here at Impact Campus Ministries is what we call “Message, Mode, and Milieu.” What do you think about that word, Brent—milieu? Have you ever heard that word before?

**Brent:** I had never heard it before Impact.

**Marty:** I hadn’t heard it until one of my friends and mentors, and was my boss at the time—he was the president of Impact before I was—his name is Bill Westfall, he was doing his dissertation work. He was getting his doctorate in global missional leadership and as he wrote his dissertation he was using these terms: message, mode, and milieu. I don’t even want to talk about milieu. It’s just a fun word to say.

**Brent:** Well, that’s a terrible tease.

**Marty:** I know.

**Brent:** You have to at least define it.

**Marty:** Yes. The idea here is that you have a message—not a message, but there is a message. We’re going to talk about this part. There’s the story of God and his invitation to join, he’s looking for partners. God’s telling a story in the world and he’s looking for partners. That story didn’t end in Revelation. We are still a part of that story today.

Then there’s the idea of mode —message, mode, and milieu. Message and mode. Mode is the idea of just making sure that we’re engaging our whole self, not just learning, not just sitting and listening to a podcast. Hopefully, this podcast enables you to go work out your faith, and really it goes beyond that. Bill’s point in his dissertation was that we as learners in our world, and we can’t do this on a podcast so we’re limited here, but we learn best when you are engaging the whole self. When your body and your heart and your mind are simultaneously, not independently but simultaneously engaged in the learning process. You learn in a completely different and more holistic way. Would you say that was true on the BEMA Trip, Brent?

**Brent:** Absolutely.

**Marty:** Your body’s engaged?

**Brent:** Completely.

**Marty:** You’re physically learning a lesson, you’re not just walking, you are learning a lesson while you walk.

**Brent:** Right.

**Marty:** At least when I’m doing my job. Then your heart is engaged, right?

**Brent:** Yes, certainly.

**Marty:** Then your mind is engaged.

**Brent:** Right.

**Marty:** You’re learning facts, you’re being convicted and provoked emotionally—all at the same time—and learning happens. My life was radically changed in Israel because of that truth. That’s mode.

Then there’s milieu. Milieu is what we call intentional relationships with other people in the story. There’s the story God is telling. We are part of the story, but there are others in this story as well and we want to make sure we have intentional relationships with other people in this great grand narrative and not just of one brand or tribe or stripe, not just of one age demographic. We need to have diverse relationships and a network of diverse relationships. That’s the idea of milieu. Milieu means an environment. Milieu is a network or an environment that you are a part of. That’s what milieu means.

When we speak of “message”—let’s go back to message. Message is the idea I want to actually bring up here—when we speak of message, the idea that we are trying to communicate is that we need to have an understanding of the whole story of God and his invitation to join that story. There is no way we can adequately address this invitation if we don’t have an understanding of what happened in between the world of the Bible and the world that you and I traverse today.

Which is why, Brent, we took all of that time at every capstone of every session, we took all that time to do what, what’d we do?

**Brent:** To review it, to remember where we came from.

**Marty:** Right. That review, we say at the beginning of every single one of those reviews, it’s so critical and essential because we have to have an understanding of the big picture and its contents. Not just a couple of sentences but we need to understand how the story has worked in the past, what’s happened, what happened all throughout the history of God’s people, what happened to Jesus, what happens when we apply Jesus, what’s happened since then to have that kind of understanding. The whole story of God and his invitation to join. Church history is a part of that.

Now before I even go any further we’re going to link in the show notes a blog post that I wrote back in 2018. During 2018 I did a rotating blog series and one of those blog series was called the “Making An Impact” series and we went through all the key terms of Impact Campus Ministries. What does disciple” and discipleship mean? What does pursue, model, teach mean? What does message, mode, milieu—what do those things mean? One of the posts in that series was the post on message. We’re going to link that, you can go read that on your own time. I enjoyed writing that whole series. You can actually use the sidebar there in my blog if you want to see the whole series. You go back to January of 2018 and just follow the series through the year and see what we did there.

Anyway, that’s message. Message is important because we need to understand the whole story of God and how He’s looking for partners. Because of this, I want to wrap up our body of work here with Session 5. I want to engage this whole story of God, including the last chapter of the story. I want to engage that now, but it’s important before we do that—

Brent, there are three things I need to say, I need to get off my chest. I need to make sure that people understand, there are three things I want to point out. Number one: I am not a historian, I’m not an expert in the field of church history, at least vocationally. Do I have a passion for history? Obviously. Have I given my whole life to it? Sure. Am I a part of a vetted academic institution that has given me a Ph.D.? No. Brent Billings, are you a historian?

**Brent:** Absolutely not. I am shamefully deficient in history. I did not care about history at all when I was in school. Now today I’m like, “Agh, it’s the one thing that I wish I would have spent all of my time on.”

**Marty:** Right. I want to make sure that before we even get started we acknowledge that together. Both of us here as hosts, we’re not historians; we’re not experts in the field of church history. Have I studied church history considerably? Yes, as part of my Bible college education, as a part of my personal study. Even today am I still studying church history? Yes, I am. Am I an expert? No, I’m not an expert at all. I am indebted to the world of real experts, some of whom I’ve been able to study with personally and some I have only read from a distance. Please do not quote me as a source in regard to church history. I am simply trying to take some of the things I have learned from others and think critically with all of you as listeners, nothing more and also nothing less. That’s my first point. I’m not a historian.

**Number two:** every historian, whether they are an expert or not, like myself, tells a story. Every historian tells a story. There is simply no such thing as an unbiased rendering of history. Each one of us sees history through the lens of our own culture, language, experience, opinion, and conviction. I want you to know upfront that I will be taking the parts of history that I believe tell the story in the most useful manner for our culture in this place and in this time. It is completely intentional and biased. Please do not ever believe anyone who doesn’t affirm that very truth in their telling of history. All renderings of history have a story to tell and all historians are storytellers.

**Brent:** We saw that with Samuel and Kings versus the Chronicles story.

**Marty:** Yes, exactly, because history for the Jews fell in which portion of scripture, Brent?

**Brent:** In the middle.

**Marty:** Yes. Between Torah, Prophets, and Writings—which part of it did it fall in?

**Brent:** Well, Samuel/Kings was in the Prophets.

**Marty:** Prophets, absolutely.

**Brent:** Chronicles was in Writings.

**Marty:** Writings. You would just think, if you just thought about it just briefly, you would want to say that all history belongs where?

**Brent:** At the end.

**Marty:** With the Writings. It’s just a writing, and yet they understood that history was prophetic in nature—that when you tell the story of history, you’re actually engaging in prophecy of some message. You are being a mouthpiece of what God wants us to understand in the way that you record history. We should not run from that truth. We should embrace that truth. We should actually allow it to challenge us to think critically about our past. That’s number two.

First one is, I’m not a historian. Number two, every historian, whether you’re a hack like me or an expert, you’re always telling a story. You always have an agenda. You always have a bias, intentional or unintentional, whether it was given to you or whether you’ve owned it. It’s true. Number three, my intent with Session 5 is not the history of the church—which like, “Wait, what? You just said we were going to journey through church history.” Yes, we’re going to journey through church history, but my intention is not to actually cover the history of the church. I will not even begin to deal adequately with any portion of church history in a comprehensive way.

I will not be doing a study on the reformers or the desert fathers. I simply want to take a broad look at where we’ve been, and how our Christian world has been shaped. This means I will be over-generalizing all the time. It means I will try my best not to do this in a misleading or disingenuous way, but I want to stay within the scope of my intentions here. This is something that’s always bothered me because when you study church history—like you spend all this time studying the Bible. You study the Bible. For us, we’ve spent almost 200 episodes studying the Bible, four sessions of the BEMA Podcast. We’re so cranked up about the Bible.

**Brent:** Something like a hundred hours talking about it.

**Marty:** Right, and then you start studying church history. I feel like Christians lose their mind in a similar way to politics or Revelation and eschatology. We all of a sudden just go to whatever little pocket of church history that we love the most, whether it’s the Reformation or the Anabaptists or the early church fathers, and we just want to dive into there to find direction and meaning and purpose. But the direction, the meaning, and the purpose was in the Text. I’m not going to get lost in the Reformation. I’m not going to get lost in all the details. There are people that are going to be church history buffs. They’re going to be furious with me after Session 5 or during Session 5. That’s okay.

I hope we can still remain friends and you don’t stop listening to our podcast, and we’ll be done with Session 5 very quickly. It’ll be a very short session, but I just want you to know my intentions are upfront because some people are going to be like, “But there’s such good stuff in that portion of history!” Yes, yes, but our podcast wanted to focus on the Text and all we’re doing now is trying to figure out what happened since the Text. What happened to the Text? What happened? We’re wanting to be text-focused. Remember we named this thing BEMA because the BEMA sat where, Brent?

**Brent:** In the center of the synagogue and you stand on it when you read the scriptures.

**Marty:** That’s right. It was in the center of the synagogue, and so we wanted to have a podcast that centered around that. We wanted to have a discipleship program, we wanted to have a ministry where the thing that sat in the center is not our history. It’s not our dogma. It’s not our doctrine. It’s the Bible. It’s the scriptures. It’s the Text. That’s what we want to center our conversation around. We’re not doing church history to do church history. We’re doing church history to understand how to apply the Text.

**Brent:** I will not be making a master diagram with a map of all of the denominations throughout church history.

**Marty:** [laughs] Oh, baby.

**Brent:** Somebody’s got to have done that.

**Marty:** It sounds like something Roger would do.

**Brent:** I can’t even imagine the scale that that would be.

**Marty:** Yes, that’s right.

**Brent:** There’s a lot of denominations there.

**Marty:** There is. There are tens of thousands, depending on who’s doing the count. 33,000–38,000, I have even heard 46,000 denominations, depending on how you define it. Alright. In this regard, there are many, many great sources for church history. I’m going to recommend a couple of books. There’s a million others. There are a million others that are probably way better than my two recommendations, but let me recommend a couple that I have spent time with.

The first one is Constantine’s Sword by James Carroll. I wouldn’t say it’s perfect. It’s just a great way to interact with some thoughts centered around church history. Some good critical thinking that you’ll do if you read that. Bruce Shelly wrote a book Church History in Plain Language. Church History in Plain Language by Bruce Shelley. Brent, you’re spending some time with ol’ Bruce.

**Brent:** I’ve been reading it.

**Marty:** Yes. How’s that journey been?

**Brent:** It’s substantial.

**Marty:** It’s substantial?

**Brent:** It’s about 500 pages, and there’s so much information in there and so much of it that I’m completely unfamiliar with. It’s been a tough read for me. I’ve been reading it very slowly, but at the same time, I feel like it’s just barely touching on everything. It is incredibly broad, but yet narrow.

**Marty:** It’s comprehensive.

**Brent:** Comprehensive, but…

**Marty:** And accessible.

**Brent:** Accessible, sure.

**Marty:** Does that mean accessible as in like easy? No, this means you can follow along, but it’ll take some work. Now if you’re like, oh my gosh, that sounds like a big, thick book—I’m going to get Constantine’s Sword.

**Brent:** [chuckles] Don’t do that.

**Marty:** Constantine’s Sword is probably twice as big. It’s a huge work, but both of them are great. They’re a great way to get started.

**Brent:** I actually didn’t finish it, as is the case with many books in my life, but I had a biography of William Tyndale. Several hundred pages about just the one guy, William Tyndale, who was translating the Bible into English back in the 1500s.

[In] 500 pages [of Church History in Plain Language], you’re not going to get that much detail, but it would at least give you—if you can make it through the whole thing, it will give you a pretty good overview of what church history has been.

**Marty:** Yes, absolutely. Let me throw another one in there, Brent. Gusto Gonzalez wrote a three-part—this is going to be even drier. [laughs] It’s going to be an even harder read, but it’s three pretty substantial volumes. I’m going to guess about 400 pages each. He wrote a three-volume series called The History of Christian Thought. It’s very much about Christian thought. It’s not about history at all. It’s not going to go over the context. It’s only going to go over how Christian thought changed over the course of—it’s just about philosophy and theology and thought. That’s all it is. The first volume was excellent, talking about just the initial—he’s even going to talk about the five responses—the Essenes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees. He does a little bit of that. It was great. That’s another one.

Then we’ve talked about the Christian History Project before. It’s impossible to link in our show notes because this is a massive multi-volume thing. We’re not even sure if it ever got finally—we have a hard time finding the later volumes. It was supposed to be 12 volumes that went through all of history. I seem to lose track of them after about volume 5 or 6. Maybe the project actually fell apart at some point.

**Brent:** I will add a link so you can at least see what it is, and maybe find it, but it has been difficult to find.

**Marty:** Yes, it’s been some of my favorites. The first three volumes are what I’m familiar with. Just beautiful. It’s visually beautiful. Very expensive, though. Anyway, maybe utilize your university library and go from there.

**Brent:** On top of that, because I am an avid podcast consumer myself, I do enjoy podcasts, and I came across this one called The Fall of Rome. It’s this guy, Patrick Wyman. He has a Ph.D. in the fall of Rome. His dissertation was on communication and travel in the Roman world, or something like that. He spent about five years studying 3,000 letters, figuring out who they were from and to, and what dialogue different parts of the Roman empire had, and how those things evolved over the course of Roman history. He doesn’t speak a ton about Christianity.

He has a couple of guests who come on and speak to that, but ideally, the Roman world was a part of life for a huge portion of the world for a very long time, including the first 5, 6, 700 years of church history that we’re going to be talking about. It’s pretty fascinating.

**Marty:** Absolutely, without a doubt. There are a ton of really great history podcasts. I’m not going to recommend any for a lot of reasons, but there are a ton of really good ones. Couple really big, big names out there that do some really cool history podcasts. At least I’ve been told of it. I’m not an avid listener of any of them, but I have been told. Just everybody I talked to is like, “ Have you heard this history podcast?” There’s some great resources out there. Dig in.

**Brent:** There are too many podcasts. I have probably 1,500 episodes on my phone, in my backlog, and I’m just never going to get through them. It’s terrible, but I love podcasts. I love making podcasts too, as you can probably tell at this point.

**Marty:** We are fans of the idea. Alright, I’m going to wrap this thing up here. Let’s close with this idea. I pointed out earlier in our time together back in Session 4. The early Christians seemed to believe that the return of Christ was imminent. He was going to return within that generation. You see that in the scriptures, you see it in the writings of the early Christians. They thought Jesus was going to return within those decades, not centuries, decades.

There’s this question, were they wrong? Of course, everybody’s going like, “Well, yes, Marty, duh.” I actually don’t believe they were. I don’t believe they were wrong. As I said earlier, I believe Jesus talked about a proper eschatology, and there were two different kinds of eschatology. Brent, what was Jesus’s favorite eschatology? If we believe in Jesus, what was the right eschatology, do you remember?

**Brent:** The three-part eschatology.

**Marty:** Right, because there was this two-part that there was this age and then the age to come, but there is a three-part. Just give me a one-sentence, two-sentence description of this three-part eschatology.

**Brent:** At the two-part, there’s a hard break between the two parts, but with the three-part, you have your initial period of this age, and then the age to come begins and it slowly fades in while this current age slowly fades out. Then eventually you do have that third part where it’s just the age to come.

**Marty:** Absolutely. That was Jesus’s eschatology. He actually critiqued John the Baptist about his two-part eschatology. Because of that eschatology and how eschatology works in Jewish thought, I do not believe there is a fixed date for Jesus’s return. I don’t believe there’s a date set in the future for the day when Jesus returns. On the contrary, I believe God is inviting us to partner with him in restoring a broken world. At some point as this redemptive arc of history is bent closer and closer to the intent of God, God will eventually snap the last few pieces into place, maybe just as the apocalyptic prophets paint the picture, or maybe differently.

This understanding that I have, I’ll say that again, the early Christians thought that Jesus was going to come back within decades—years, not centuries. I don’t think they were wrong, because I don’t think the date of Christ’s return was fixed. I think that there was something happening in the world. This idea, by the way, is found in your scriptures. The idea runs congruent with the Jewish understanding that Peter uses. He has a portion where he says something that I’ve heard very few people teach on. It’s rooted in a Pharisaical school of eschatology, and this is what he says in your inspired Bible. Go ahead and read us this, Brent.

**Brent:** You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire and the elements will melt in heat, but in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth where righteousness dwells.

**Marty:** Give me that first sentence one more time, Brent.

**Brent:** You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.

**Marty:** “Speed its coming.” There’s something about engaging in the mitzvah. There’s something about doing the good deeds. There’s something about walking righteously. Later, the Jews would call this tikkun olam, tikkun olam. This idea of repairing the world. If there’s a good Wikipedia article on tikkun olam, we’re going to link that in the show notes here. This idea of we are engaged in, we are partnering in tikkun olam, the repairing of the world. Apparently, the day of God is not fixed. The day of God, the day of the Lord is not fixed but stands in relation to us. Our obedience somehow speeds up its coming.

That’s what Peter said. It’s right there in the text. Peter says, “We speed its coming, we speed up its coming.” Just as we saw in the end of our study of the New Testament, this commitment and radical obedience by the early believers was working. It was working. The most powerful empire in the world was crumbling. The dragon was going to be thrown into the fire, the beast, it was all being done away with. I don’t believe they were wrong to think that the coming of Christ and a new heaven and a new earth prophesied by Isaiah, re-announced by Peter, Paul and John, I don’t think they were wrong to think that it was speedily approaching.

Then something happened. We seem to lose the plot. I want to look at that in Session 5. I want to look at what that something might have been. That will be my invitation at the end of this episode, to join me through the next 10 episodes or so as we begin to walk through the last 2,000 years, asking ourselves if Christ was right at the doorstep, what happened that led us to where we’re at today?

Those are my thoughts and my stage setting for Session 5, Brent. We’re ready to get into AD 30 through whatever our first section is going to be, next episode.

**Brent:** 100–300.

**Marty:** 100–300, that is our first date set. Makes sense. Domitian was right at the end of the 1st century. We’re going to pick up right where we left off, after Revelation. 100–300, you said?

**Brent:** Yes.

**Marty:** Excellent. Wonderful.

**Brent:** That’ll do it for this episode. Thanks for joining us on the BEMA Podcast. We’ll talk to you again soon.
