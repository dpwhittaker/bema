# BEMA Episode 200: AD 1650-1800

## Episode Overview
This episode journeys through 150 years of Protestant history, following the world from the Reformation through the Age of Enlightenment. Marty and Brent explore how scientific revolution (Newton, Locke), political philosophy (Voltaire), and religious freedom (Edict of Nantes) transformed Western culture, leading to the French Revolution and the beginning of the post-Christian era.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Continuing Scientific Revolution
The Age of Enlightenment's secular growth curve continued from the previous episode. If Copernicus and Galileo "rocked the very foundations of our assumptions about the universe," they were only "setting the stage for what we would call today 'modernity' or the modern era."

**Isaac Newton**:
- Famous for laws of motion
- Considered modern father of mechanics
- Engineering students "have Newton to thank for so much of the field that they enjoy"
- Did incredible work in field of color and the light spectrum (photographers appreciate this too)
- Changed how we think about physics
- Set stage for technological advancement like never before

**John Locke**:
- Known as "father of liberalism"
- **Important**: In earliest forms, liberalism meant a line of political philosophy believing in **liberty and equality**
- Locke's influence on the Declaration of Independence is "unmistakable"
- American democracy works (on good days) because of tension/balance between liberalism and conservatism
- One philosophy bent toward complete freedom, the other toward maintaining constant ethic
- Locke greatly impacted major thinkers in the next century

### Protestant Freedom and Division

**The Edict of Nantes** (signed 1598):
- Granted Protestants civil liberty and equality
- Protestants no longer had to run around as heretics under Holy Roman Empire oppression
- Had two major results

**Two Results of Protestant Freedom**:

**Positive**: This newfound freedom allowed people to:
- Think for themselves
- Study, publish, and teach their theological beliefs, theories, and systems

**Negative**: Protestantism no longer had a central system holding it together
- Lost the "catholic element" (lowercase c - meaning universal unity)
- As Europe splintered and migration increased
- Mass division and splitting of Christian thought
- Increased exponentially for the next 200 years

**Marty's Note**: "Not that such diversity is necessarily a bad thing, but it definitely has its struggles as does anything else."

### John Wesley and Methodism
Breaking away from the Anglican faith, **John Wesley**:
- Became father of Methodism and the Methodist Church
- Argued adamantly against premises of Calvinism
- Preached vehemently about:
  - Personal repentance
  - Confession
  - Power of our personal will to be transformed
  - Pursuing the holiness of God
- Christianity has been unbelievably impacted by his influence

**Book Recommendation**: "Rediscovering Discipleship" by Robby Gallaty
- Marty is "really hard to please" when it comes to discipleship books
- But this one is "really great"
- Has chapters on history of discipleship
- Focuses on John Wesley's commitment to discipleship
- Before getting too critical of this era, Marty wanted to recommend this book

### Voltaire and Separation of Church and State
**Voltaire** (French writer and philosopher):
- Widely praised for satirical attacks on Catholic Church and established religion in general
- Used wit and cutting sense of humor
- Argued for:
  - Freedom of religion
  - Freedom of speech
- Shaped ideas we know today as **separation of church and state**
- Quick to point out (accurately, Marty adds) the **danger of religion when mixed with power of the state**
- The danger of "Christendom and its negative implications"

**Major Impact**: This had huge effect on public and educated opinion, ultimately leading to:
- The French Revolution
- What we now call the **post-Christian era**

### The Post-Christian Era
Starting with the French Revolution, the world shifted into what Marty calls the post-Christian era.

**What This Means**:
> "If you used to unplug the world and plug it back in, it would blink Christian as default... Post-French Revolution, the world shifted and tilted away from that reality... if you unplug the world and plug it back in, it no longer blinked Christian. It now blinked whatever you want to call it, secular culture, Post-Christian era."

**Current Reality**:
- The church continued to see decline in its influence (politically and culturally)
- Loss of privilege over centuries to come
- "Something much of the church is still in denial about to this very day"
- **Especially** "the fundamentalist evangelical movement that I call home"

**American Exception**: It took longer for this reality to reach America than other parts of the world.

### The Great Migration to America
During this period, mass migration to America was happening:
- Cultural tenor set stage for Declaration of Independence
- American Revolution was prepared for by thinkers like Locke and Voltaire
- The "pump has been primed" for ideals leading to European revolution and American independence
- Cultural wave was moving westward geographically

**Brent's Observation**:
Looking at the names discussed (Wesley, Newton from England; Voltaire from France):
- Moving more and more away from Rome
- Away from Catholic sphere of influence
- Luther was very early on (German, eastern)
- Now everything shifting westward
- Moving into northwest Europe, then jumping across Atlantic to America

## Historical Context and Key Events

### The Shift from Roman Influence
The cultural center of power and thought was shifting:
- Away from Rome and Mediterranean
- Toward northwestern Europe (England, France)
- Eventually across Atlantic to North America

### Scholasticism's Legacy
From previous episode: Scholasticism put the church in a position where:
- It was no longer driving cultural progress
- Instead being pulled along by secular advancement
- This dynamic continues through this period

### The Interplay of Movements
- Protestant Reformation → freedom of thought
- Scientific revolution → new understanding of natural world
- Political philosophy → new ideas about governance
- All happening simultaneously, influencing each other
- Together creating conditions for massive cultural shift

## Important Terms and Definitions

**The Edict of Nantes** (1598): Royal decree granting Protestants civil liberties and religious freedom in Catholic France

**Liberalism**: In original form, political philosophy emphasizing liberty and equality (not the modern political definition)

**Conservatism**: Philosophy bent toward maintaining constant ethics and traditional values

**Methodism**: Protestant movement founded by John Wesley emphasizing personal holiness, social justice, and transformed lives

**The Holy Roman Empire**: Political entity combining Catholic Church authority with state power (what was being overthrown in this period)

**Voltaire** (François-Marie Arouet): French Enlightenment writer and philosopher who satirized church corruption and championed freedom

**Separation of Church and State**: Political principle that religious institutions and government should operate independently

**Post-Christian Era**: Period beginning with French Revolution when Western culture no longer defaults to Christian assumptions

**The French Revolution** (1789-1799): Overthrow of French monarchy and transformation of society; key turning point toward post-Christian culture

**Secular**: Non-religious; concerning worldly rather than spiritual matters

## Practical Applications

### Understanding Faith and Science Coexistence
Newton and others show that:
- Scientific advancement doesn't require abandoning faith
- Many scientific pioneers were people of faith
- The adversarial relationship between science and faith is not inevitable
- We can appreciate both realms without forcing them to compete

### Learning from Political Philosophy
Locke reminds us:
- Liberty and equality are valuable political goals
- Balance between freedom and ethical constancy is healthy
- Church thinkers have contributed to political philosophy
- We shouldn't demonize all "liberal" thought (in original sense)

### Heeding Voltaire's Warning
The danger of mixing religion with state power:
- When Christianity has political power, it often becomes oppressive
- Voltaire's critique of Christendom was accurate
- Separation of church and state protects both religion and governance
- We should be wary of nostalgia for "Christian America" if it means state power

### Accepting Post-Christian Reality
Instead of denying we live in post-Christian culture:
- Acknowledge the shift honestly
- Understand we can't "unplug and replug" culture back to Christian default
- Learn to be faithful witnesses in post-Christian context
- Stop expecting cultural privilege Christianity once had

### Appreciating John Wesley
Before being too critical of this era:
- Remember figures like Wesley who emphasized discipleship
- Study how movements emphasized personal transformation
- Learn from commitment to holiness and social engagement
- Don't throw out the good with the problematic

## Study Questions

1. What does Marty mean by "post-Christian era"? What are signs that we live in such an era? How should Christians respond?

2. Voltaire warned about dangers of religion mixed with state power. Do you agree with his critique? What are examples of this danger in history?

3. The Edict of Nantes brought both freedom and fragmentation to Protestantism. How do we assess movements with both positive and negative effects?

4. Why is the church "still in denial" about loss of cultural privilege and influence? What would it look like to honestly accept post-Christian reality?

5. Marty notes Isaac Newton, Blaise Pascal, and others were people of faith advancing science. How does this challenge the narrative that science and faith are inherently opposed?

6. John Locke's "liberalism" meant liberty and equality. How has this term been distorted? Why do we need to understand historical context of political terms?

7. The cultural center was shifting westward (Rome → northwestern Europe → America). What does this geographic shift reveal about power and influence?

8. Brent notes that as the world "breaks apart" there's more to wrap your mind around. How do we handle increasing complexity in church history and theology?

9. Wesley emphasized personal will, transformation, and holiness. How does this balance with Reformed emphases on grace and sovereignty?

10. What are the implications of Marty's observation that "the Church has been trailing behind, being pulled forward" by culture since Scholasticism?
