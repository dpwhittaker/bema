# Episode 193: AD 100-300

## Episode Metadata
- **Episode Number:** 193
- **Title:** AD 100-300
- **Season:** 5
- **Air Date:** October 29, 2020
- **Duration:** 23 minutes (approximate)
- **Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings

## Episode Overview
This episode examines the second and third centuries of church history, addressing the fundamental question: "Why are we so not-Jewish in our Christian practice today?" Marty explores two competing theories about the Jewish-Gentile schism and argues that the separation happened later than many assume—not during the Paul-James tension, but during the Trajan and Hadrian persecutions (AD 114-120). This schism had devastating consequences: Gentile Christians lost their connection to the Text and Jewish teachers, leading to Gnostic influence and anti-Semitic drift.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### Clarifying the Podcast's Approach
Marty reiterates the disclaimer from Episode 192:
- This is NOT comprehensive church history
- He's not an expert in church history
- Taking a "10,000-foot perspective" with sweeping observations
- Primary interest: What happened to the Bible? What happened to us in relation to Scripture?
- Church history buffs will be frustrated by lack of detail—that's okay
- Focus: The Text, not history for history's sake

### The Central Question
How did a movement that began with:
- An incredibly Jewish story
- A Jewish rabbi (Jesus)
- Jewish talmidim (disciples)
- Jewish scriptures and practices

Become so completely separated from its Jewish foundation?

## Two Competing Theories of the Schism

### Theory #1: Early Schism (Paul vs. James) - REJECTED by Marty

**The Theory:**
- A much more defined schism between Jewish and Gentile church early on
- Jerusalem church (James) vs. Pauline expansion (Asia/Asia Minor)
- Some liberal/progressive scholars believe Paul and James were "completely different churches"
- Judaism jettisons its Jesus-following believers (mostly Gentile) because:
  - The aggressive euangelion (Gospel proclamation) violated the Jewish Exception
  - Under the Jewish Exception, Jews were exempt from emperor worship but couldn't aggressively proselytize
  - The Jesus movement was "bent on invitation," creating unwanted political tension
  - At the height of Pax Romana, this was challenging the status quo and upsetting empire

**Why This Theory Exists:**
- Undeniable tension in the book of Acts between Jerusalem and Asia churches
- Tension visible at the Jerusalem Council
- The aggressive evangelism of the Jesus movement did create imperial problems

**Marty's Problems with This Theory:**
- While tension existed, the apostolic leaders came to agreement led by the Holy Spirit
- Binding and loosing process (Session 4) resolved conflicts
- Recent archaeological evidence contradicts this theory

**New Archaeological Evidence:**
- For decades, critics said there was "no evidence that Jews and Gentiles ever worshiped together"
- Last 20 years: Archaeological efforts in modern Turkey (Asia/Asia Minor) have found evidence of Jews and Gentiles worshiping together
- David Flusser (Jewish scholar, not a Jesus follower) suggested decades ago that early Christianity was predominantly a Jewish movement without such internal tensions until much later
- His theory was unpopular in both Jewish and Christian scholarship
- Now being vindicated by archaeological finds

### Theory #2: Later Schism (Trajan/Hadrian Persecutions) - MARTY'S POSITION

**The Timeline:**
- AD 114-120 window
- Trajan and Hadrian (Roman emperors) led aggressive persecutions
- Targeted Jews, not Christians specifically
- Includes the Bar Kochba revolt

**Why Did Rome Target Jews Instead of Christians?**
Key insight: Christians were SO JEWISH at that point that they were seen as an indistinguishable part of Judaism.

**The Imperial Threat:**
- Rome required worship/sacrifices to the Emperor and taxes
- Jews were exempt (Jewish Exception)
- If "Christian Judaism" swept through the Empire, Rome would lose massive tax revenue
- The Empire runs on Imperial commitment, patriotism, fear
- A new Gospel (euangelion) was a major problem Rome wouldn't ignore

**What Happened:**
1. **Initially:** Most of Judaism stood behind their Gentile converts (theosabes/God-fearers)
   - When Rome came to persecute Jews, Jewish communities said: "These Gentiles are part of our family, you can't touch them"
   - Synagogue of Satan (Revelation) was the exception—Jews who betrayed Gentile believers

2. **The Betrayal:** When Rome came looking to extinguish Judaism, "these same Gentiles seem to turn their backs on their Jewish brothers and sisters"
   - Gentiles fell back on their uncircumcised roots
   - Said: "Are you here for the Jews? We're not Jewish and we've got the foreskin to prove it"
   - Left their Jewish counterparts "out to dry"

3. **The Result:** Created a schism that has never healed—in fact, it's been exacerbated

**Evidence for This Theory:**
- Explains why writings of the early church fathers (just one or two generations removed from apostles) are already "super anti-Semitic"
- Example: Irenaeus (late 2nd century)—disciple of the disciples, already vehemently anti-Semitic
- Marty's aside: "Irenaeus is great, has a lot of wonderful things to contribute to church history—but was horribly exclusive"

## The Catastrophic Consequences

### Loss of Connection to the Text
With Jews gone, this Jesus-following body lost:
- Walking libraries of Torah
- The Jewish narrative to teach and lead them
- Their anchor to Scripture
- Remember: "a good millennium away from the printing press"
- No BibleGateway.com, no Bible app
- Scripture was supposed to be in your head (oral culture)

**The Question from Romans:** What would it be to have all the Jews leave, and now you have to figure out how to do this thing as Gentiles?

### Gnostic Influence Fills the Vacuum
When the Jewish anchor was pulled up, Gentiles leaned on the only thing they knew intimately: **Hellenistic worldview dominated by Gnosticism**

**About Gnosticism:**
- Marty acknowledges we're learning more about Gnosticism (even things recently taught by scholars like N.T. Wright may need revision)
- Hesitant to overstate, but clear negative attributes exist
- The core problem: **Dualism**
  - Separation of spirit and soil
  - Body and spirit divided
  - All things spiritual = good
  - All things physical = bad
- Docetism (belief that Jesus only appeared to have a physical body)

**Why This Happened:**
When you lose Torah but still need to think and talk about God, you default to what you're familiar with. For Gentiles, this was Hellenistic dualism.

"This conflicting worldview led to corrupted teachings and beliefs."

### Marcion and Canon Formation

**Marcion's Argument (Early Church):**
- Rejected the Tanakh (Hebrew Scriptures)
- Rejected most of the Gospels (accepted parts of Luke)
- Fully accepted Paul's letters
- Accepted a few other New Testament letters
- Basically: Tanakh bad, Matthew/Mark/John mostly bad, Paul and Luke good

**Sound Familiar?**
"Much of evangelical Christianity continues to approach the New Testament in the same way."

- We gravitate toward Paul
- "Jesus is kind of hard to understand, but Paul we love"
- BEMA listeners always say: "You've made the Old Testament come alive!"—because we don't talk about the Old Testament

**The Irony:**
- Marcion was eventually declared a heretic
- His arguments were completely rejected by Christianity
- Yet today we have a "very Marcion-like view and approach to Scripture and theology"
- "We talk about how Marcion was a heretic and yet we really approach the Bible in many of the same ways"
- "That was heresy for the early Christians"

### The Muratorian Canon
Marcion's heresy brought up the need to declare:
- Which teachings would be authoritative
- Which books belong in the Bible

**The Result:**
- The Muratorian Canon (a long process, not immediate)
- Initially had only 22 of the 27 New Testament letters
- Later conversations led to reordering of Hebrew scriptures for Christians
- Had "an undeniable anti-Semitic bent to it"
- Eventually grew to include more books
- This canon is "really the Bible... the basis of the Bible that you and I use today"

## The Third Century: Survival Mode

### Roman Persecution as a Limiting Factor
Paradoxically, persecution helped somewhat:
- If Gentile Christians hadn't been at odds with Rome, it probably would have "spun out of control even quicker"
- "They were simply trying to survive at this point. Rome is out to extinguish the Christian movement."
- Persecution kept the theological drift from spiraling even further out of control
- Forced Christians to "bind together and cling to the essentials for the survival of their faith"

**The Tragedy:**
"It's a dark shame that we weren't able to do this with the company and the leadership provided by our Jewish brothers and sisters. We will be left to wonder what could have been."

### The Pattern of Persecution
Like Republicans and Democrats going back and forth:
- Some emperors: "I'm going to destroy this group"—like modern discourse about immigrants, outsiders, Muslims
- Other emperors: "We're going to embrace this, accept this, move forward together"
- Third century was constant ups and downs: "Okay, we can breathe... okay we need to run"

**The Macro-Context:**
- The Roman Empire in the third century was struggling
- Persecutions were scapegoating—a way to deal with their problems
- Easy to point the finger at vulnerable populations
- Marty's sarcastic aside: "Luckily we don't do that today [sarcasm], it's wonderful. We've evolved so far from those kinds of silly, petty scapegoating techniques."

## Theological and Historical Insights

### Was Jesus About to Return?
Connecting to Episode 192's discussion of three-part eschatology and "speeding the coming":

**Marty's Theory:**
- The age to come (olam haba) was imminent
- Jesus was possibly "on the doorstep"—"Is it time, Dad? Is it time for me to come back?"
- Then "this thing spun out of control"
- The schism was the "something" that happened

**The Haunting Question:**
"If we would have not separated from our Jewish roots, would the age to come have arrived and Jesus's return been realized just as the writers of the New Testament were claiming? Maybe so."

This reframes the Jewish-Gentile schism not as a minor historical footnote but as a catastrophic derailment of redemptive history.

### The Schism That Never Healed
- Created in AD 114-120
- Never healed in the Jewish-Gentile world
- Actually exacerbated over the subsequent 1,900 years
- "That's for the rest of Session 5, we'll talk about it"

## Practical Applications

### Recognizing Our Marcionite Tendencies
Self-examination questions:
- Do I gravitate toward Paul and neglect the Gospels?
- Do I find Jesus "hard to understand" but Paul clear and practical?
- Do I neglect the Old Testament (Tanakh)?
- Have I unconsciously adopted the very heresy (Marcion's approach) that the early church rejected?

### Understanding Gnostic Influence
Check your own theology for dualism:
- Do I view physical things as less holy than spiritual things?
- Do I separate "soul" work from "body" work?
- Do I elevate "spiritual" ministry over physical service?
- Have I absorbed Hellenistic worldview rather than Hebraic worldview?

### The Importance of Jewish Connection
- What we lost when we lost Jewish leadership: walking libraries of Torah, connection to the Text, proper hermeneutic
- What we need to recover: Jewish roots, Hebraic worldview, connection to the whole biblical narrative
- Why BEMA exists: to reconnect Gentile Christians with their Jewish foundation

### Scapegoating Then and Now
Marty's contemporary critique:
- The Roman pattern of scapegoating minorities continues today
- We still blame "those people" for societal problems
- Immigrants, outsiders, religious minorities face similar dynamics
- We haven't "evolved" as much as we'd like to think

## Study Questions

1. How does understanding the later timing of the Jewish-Gentile schism (AD 114-120 vs. during Paul/James) change your view of the New Testament?

2. What might have been different if Gentile Christians had stood by their Jewish brothers and sisters during the Trajan/Hadrian persecutions?

3. In what ways does modern evangelical Christianity mirror Marcion's heretical approach to Scripture (elevating Paul, neglecting Old Testament)?

4. How does Gnostic dualism (spirit good, body bad) show up in contemporary Christian practice and theology?

5. If our obedience can "speed the coming" of Christ's return (Episode 192), could our disobedience—like the schism—delay it? What are the implications?

6. How do we see scapegoating of vulnerable populations in our own cultural moment? How should Christians respond differently than Rome did?

7. What does it practically look like to recover connection to our Jewish roots without appropriating Jewish identity?

8. How does the Muratorian Canon's "anti-Semitic bent" continue to shape how we read and order Scripture today?

## Closing Thoughts

This episode presents a devastating thesis: the church's separation from its Jewish roots in AD 114-120 was not just a regrettable historical development, but potentially a catastrophic derailment of redemptive history itself. If Jesus's return stood in relation to our obedience (Episode 192), then the Gentile betrayal of their Jewish brothers and sisters may have delayed the age to come.

The consequences were immediate and severe:
1. Loss of connection to the Text (no more walking libraries of Torah)
2. Gnostic influence filling the vacuum (spirit/body dualism)
3. Anti-Semitism within one or two generations
4. Canon formation with anti-Semitic bent
5. A Marcionite approach to Scripture that persists today

The irony is painful: Marcion was declared a heretic, yet evangelical Christianity largely mirrors his approach—elevating Paul, neglecting the Old Testament, finding Jesus "hard to understand." We rejected Marcion's theology while absorbing his methodology.

The schism never healed. In fact, it was exacerbated. The rest of Session 5 will explore how.

But beneath Marty's historical analysis lies a prophetic critique: We've lost the plot. We traded our Jewish foundation for Hellenistic philosophy. We chose survival over solidarity. We said "we're not Jewish" to save our skins, and in doing so, lost our anchor to the Text.

The haunting question remains: "What could have been?" If we had stood with our Jewish brothers and sisters, if we had maintained connection to the Text through Jewish teachers, if we hadn't betrayed the very people who first welcomed us into the family of Abraham—would Jesus have returned? Would the age to come have arrived?

Maybe so.

Instead, they run for their lives. They stand and die. But it's all about to change—and Episode 194 will reveal how Constantine transforms everything.
