# BEMA Episode 203: You Are Here

## Episode Overview
This pivotal episode marks the culmination of the entire BEMA journey. Marty presents his "Four Pillars of BEMA" - Text, Community, Discipleship, and Wrestling - as the essential elements lost from first-century Judaism that we must recover. The episode concludes with a prophetic reading from Emmylou Harris's "Time in Babylon," calling listeners to examine how Empire (Babylon) still holds us captive.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Journey's End: "You Are Here"
"If you're here today, you're here today." - Simple but profound

The journey from "b'reisheit bara Elohim" (in the beginning) to this very day is complete. Now Marty wants to summarize what he's learned and been trying to teach through this body of work.

**Like His Israel/Turkey Trips**: After 12 days together, Marty summarizes the experience. He wants to do the same for this long BEMA journey.

### The Four Pillars of BEMA

Marty identifies four things that stand out from first-century church (couched in first-century Judaism), visible throughout scripture from the very beginning.

**The Tongue-in-Cheek Reference**:
- Just like Alexander the Great had his "Four Pillars of Hellenism"
- Now Marty has his "Four Pillars of BEMA"
- "If Alexander Great can have four pillars, so can I"

These often appear in extended form at Marty's weekend events (2+ hours, sometimes whole weekends).

## PILLAR 1: TEXT

**What They Had**:
The first-century Jewish world was "deeply committed to the Text":
- Loved their Text
- Teaching children to memorize entire Torah at very early age
- Then much of rest of Tanakh
- Had working knowledge of God's commandments "we can hardly begin to understand"

**The Power of Oral Tradition**:
Without printing press, this oral communication and commitment to memory proved "invaluable to an entire culture of people devoted to following God."

**What We Lost**:
> "Unfortunately, when we lost our connection to our Jewish heritage by rejecting the Jewish identity upon which we were built, we didn't just lose relationships with the Jewish people, that would be bad enough. Even worse, we lost the written word of God as well."

Not literally - "we have the Bible" - but:
> "We think we've done great because we've preserved the Bible, and we have the Bible and have the Bible, but we lost the Bible Bible."

**The Critical Distinction**:
> "There's a difference between having a Bible on your shelf and having the Bible in you."

**Isaiah 55**: The Word that "doesn't return void, but always accomplishes the purpose for which it was sent"
- When we lose those words, we lose power of our movement
- Ephesians: Word of God is the **sword of the Spirit**

**The Exchange We Made**:
> "I believe we lost the power of the Spirit by losing our connection to the Text, exchanging it for a fascination, maybe even idolatry of doctrine and creed."

**Pushback Addressed**:
Some say: "No, no, no, Marty, we don't need the Bible like that because that's what the Jews got wrong. We just need the Holy Spirit."

Marty's response: In the very Bible we say is inspired and infallible, it calls the Spirit "the sword of the Spirit, the word of God." Those two things are intimately connected. "If you take the word away, I believe personally, you take away a very key connection to the work of the Holy Spirit."

---

## PILLAR 2: COMMUNITY

**Hellenistic Deception**:
"Our Hellenistic ways always deceive us."

As we jettisoned connection to Jewish world (living in intentional subversion to pagan narrative), we were left with our own pagan roots "deeply entrenched in the narrative of empire, and the Roman worldview."

**What We Chose Instead**:
Instead of living in intentional community rejecting lies of:
- Self-preservation
- Luxury
- Comfort
- Leisure

We embraced (and still do) these "tools of the Empire."

**The Most Fascinating Tool**:
> "The most fascinating and effective tool of the Kingdom is an inclusive community, an inclusive community that shows the world a better way to live."

**What "Inclusive" Means**:
NOT just friendships or having buddies and fellow believers.

> "I'm talking about radical fellowship with people you don't agree with. That's what makes the church the church, that's what makes it a Eucharistic community."

---

## PILLAR 3: DISCIPLESHIP

**The First-Century Model**:
One of best ways of training up leaders was first century discipleship model.

**What Jesus Did (and Didn't Do)**:
> "Consider the fact that Jesus started no churches and went on no missionary journeys. What he did do, and then asked us to do, was make disciples."

**The Method**:
- Spent three years with 12 young men
- All day, every day
- (And some women too)
- Changed the course of human history

**What He Didn't Do**:
- Didn't lead Bible studies (though they're great)
- Didn't create awesome new conferences to teach masses (though incredibly beneficial, Marty has loved many)

> "He simply went out, told 12 guys to follow me, and then showed them how to live as God had asked them to live. It changed everything and we don't do this anymore. We just don't do it anymore."

---

## PILLAR 4: WRESTLING

**The Pattern from Jacob**:
Early church community was devoted to same wrestling that Jacob (father of Israelites, back in Session 1) was known for.

**What They Believed**:
- Didn't think answers to all questions were the point
- Believed Text was meant to be wrestled with
- Life was tricky and difficult
- Did NOT believe in formulas or self-help strategies
- Believed in walking the path with faithfulness

**The Way**:
"This walk, this walking of the way":
- Meant things could be quite complicated and messy
- Many shades of gray
- But working with God to restore the world would be worth the great wrestling match

**What We Lost**:
"But this too, was something we lost."

Why? "Because we had lost the Text, questions and doubts were threatening our doctrines and our Creeds."

**The Shift**:
We immediately:
- Began to identify orthodox answers to questions
- Discouraged dissent
- This in a world founded on culture of **chutzpah** (remember Session 1, Session 2, Elijah)
- Chutzpah and engagement were encouraged in Judaism
- We created "an odd experiment that didn't look like that"

---

## What We Lost (Summary)

1. Lost the Text
2. Disengaged from subversively-inclusive community
3. Stopped making disciples the way Jesus did
4. Discouraged wrestling

---

## Where We Are Today

**Current Reality**:
- We still don't know our Text
- Find it nearly impossible to experiment with true community because of "idolatry of our consumerism and comfort"
- We have labels and groups: Republicans/Democrats, liberals/conservatives, ethnic identities - "so many ways to divide ourselves"
- Run church programs and invest in programmatic ministries rather than believing discipleship could change the world
- Still discourage people from asking questions that push boundaries or color outside lines

**Brent**: "It's a little bit convicting."

**Marty**: "That's good. I'm glad."

---

## Is There Any Hope?

**Marty's Answer**: "YES, despite all my criticism and pessimism"

> "God has placed you and me here for such a time as this."

### HOPE FOR TEXT:
**Because of the internet**:
- Unprecedented amount of Bible study tools and information at fingertips
- Unlike any other point in human history
- Accessibility to truth at all-time high

Even though we struggle to have knowledge rivaling Orthodox Judaism:
> "We do have the tools to pursue that kind of understanding and keep learning, learning, learning."

> "If the disciples knew that we had biblegateway.com or online lexicons to do word searches in a matter of seconds... they would roll over in their graves. There's no reason we cannot create our own kind of Essene community, people who seek to know the path and walk the path."

### HOPE FOR COMMUNITY:
> "No matter the time or place in history, if we are human, then we are capable of great community."

No reason we can't create:
- Subversively inclusive communities
- Show lies of our culture's idolatry for what it is
- Show way of Jesus as best way to live
- "Even after all these centuries, we can still create communities that teach the world how to Sabbath, how to forgive, how to be generous and hospitable to other people"
- Can look out for the mumzers/mamzers

**Because of Connectivity**:
> "We have tools to facilitate community like never before."

COVID-19 pandemic showed us:
- Logged into Zoom
- Created new communities
- Created new ways of connection

> "We have the tools. It simply requires that we do not settle for pseudo-community that allows us to keep our Herodian idolatry of consumerism and neo-Hellenism. We have to make the sacrifices necessary for true, true community."

### HOPE FOR DISCIPLESHIP:
> "I remain convinced that this method and this model of discipleship would be just as effective in our world as it ever was in the Greco-Roman context."

**Total immersion**:
- Into a way of living
- Into a way of walking
- "Still the best context for true learning and true transformation"

**The Challenge**:
- Not easy to fit into our world
- We don't live in culture that facilitates these commitments
- But the Great Commission still sits for us to seize today more than ever

**Brent's Insight**: "I've experienced something like this, on-the-job training."

**Marty**: We know how to do this in right context. "The problem is we haven't facilitated our faith communities and those particular spaces in context for this experience."

### HOPE FOR WRESTLING:
> "Maybe one of the best things postmodernity has given us is a culture that values the complexities of life and rejects the notion of black and white answers."

**Marty loves this about Millennials and Gen Z**.

**Context Often Misidentified**:
- Often seen as "moral relativism"
- "That's not what it is. It's not that. It can be, but that's not what it is"
- "This context is not our enemy. It is an incredible opportunity"

**What We Need**:
> "We need to recapture a world where questions are not a threat to our systems of control, but the doorway to discovery. We need to trust the process of searching, believing that if we truly do search for God, we will find him just as he promised us."

## Time in Babylon: A Prophetic Warning

Before closing, Marty wants to wrestle "not just with abstract concepts" but "examine our own participation in the world of empire and how that idolatry has its claws in us."

**Connection to Session 2**:
Remember "Out of Babylon" by Walter Brueggemann (recommended 30 million times in Session 2)?

Brueggemann's book uses as foundation a song by **Emmylou Harris** called "Time in Babylon."

**Marty's Conviction**:
> "I wonder if [we're] not really still, in so many ways, a Babylon that we find ourselves exiled in, often maybe not even aware of it."

### Selected Lyrics from "Time in Babylon":

> Five-lane highway danger zone.
> SUV and a speakerphone.
> You need that chrome
> To get you home
> Doing time in Babylon.

> Cluster mansion on a hill,
> Another day in Pleasantville.
> If you don't like it,
> Take a pill
> Doing time in Babylon.

> In the land of the proud and free
> You can sell your soul and your dignity
> For 15 minutes on TV,
> Doing time in Babylon.

> So suck the fat and cut the bone,
> And fill it up with silicone.
> Everybody must get cloned
> Doing time in Babylon.

---

> We came from apple pie and mom
> Through civil rights and banned the bomb
> To Watergate and Vietnam
> Hard times in Babylon

> Rallied round the megaphone
> Gave it up and just got stoned.
> Now it's Prada, Gucci, and Perone
> Doing time in Babylon.

---

> Get results and get them fast.
> We're ready if you got the cash,
> Someone else will be laughing last,
> Doing time in Babylon.

> So put that conscience on the shelf.
> Keep the best stuff for yourself.
> Let the rest fight over what is left,
> Doing time in Babylon.

---

**CHORUS**:
> Little boy blue, come blow your horn.
> The cows are in the corn.
> The morning sky is red and falling down.
> The Piper's at the till
> And he's coming for the kill.
> Luring all our children underground in Babylon.

---

**FINAL REFRAIN**:
> You let your song of healing spark
> A way out of this dark.
> Lead us to a higher and a holy ground.

---

## Marty's Closing Prayer

> "In a lot of ways, that would be my prayer for our journey, that we would let the prophet convict us, and that the song of the prophet would be a way out of our darkness leading us to a higher and a holy ground."

### Starting with Realistic Goals

You won't wake up tomorrow and do all these things like a champ.

**But you can**:
- Wake up tomorrow
- Set realistic and attainable goals
- Begin making new ground in all four areas

**Marty's Personal Journey**:
> "I know that, Brent, because that's how my journey started. I came back from Israel, 2008. I just wanted to start memorizing one paragraph every week of the Bible. I just kept adding little bits and pieces, as that stuff got inside of me, I wanted to live it out. I just kept experimenting, just kept trying."

**The Pattern**:
- Started with realistic goals
- Lots of failure
- Lots of failure (repeated for emphasis)
- But commitment to grow in things he now believes in a whole new way

### The Journey of 1000 Miles

> "I believe some wise man once said, the journey of 1000 miles begins with what, Brent Billings?"

**Brent**: "One step."

### Closing with Talmud

> "Just as rain falls in drops and forms mighty rivers, so it is with Torah. A man studies a little here and a little there, until understanding comes like a rushing spring."

> "May it be so in our day, Lord. Amen."

- Build like rain forming rivers

### Community
**Don't Settle**:
- Don't accept pseudo-community
- Sacrifice consumerism and comfort for real connection
- Fellowship with people you disagree with
- Use digital tools to facilitate (but not replace) real community

### Discipleship
**Total Immersion**:
- Create contexts for on-the-job training
- Invite people to follow, then show them how to live
- Don't just run programs - make disciples

### Wrestling
**Embrace Questions**:
- Questions are doorways to discovery, not threats to control
- Trust the searching process
- Value complexity over simplistic answers
- Millennials and Gen Z can lead us here

### Recognizing Babylon
**Examine Ourselves**:
- Where does consumerism have us?
- What idols of comfort and leisure control us?
- How do we participate in Empire?
- Are we exiled without knowing it?

## The Four Pillars of BEMA (Summary)

1. **TEXT**: Having the Bible IN you, not just on your shelf; the sword of the Spirit
2. **COMMUNITY**: Radical, subversively inclusive fellowship even with those you disagree with
3. **DISCIPLESHIP**: Total immersion into a way of living; following and showing, not just teaching
4. **WRESTLING**: Questions as doorways to discovery; valuing complexity and faithful walking over formulas
