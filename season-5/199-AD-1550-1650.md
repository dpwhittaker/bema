# BEMA Episode 199: AD 1550-1650

## Episode Overview
This episode covers one remarkable century that saw unprecedented change and progress, both inside and outside the church. Marty and Brent explore the fertile soil that made the Reformation possible: scientific revolution, political transformation, and the birth of democracy. The collision of faith and science forced the church to grow, often painfully, in its understanding of both theology and the natural world.

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### The Reformation as Survival Mechanism
Marty makes a provocative claim: "Without the Reformation, I don't believe Christianity would have survived the 200 years after it."

This statement has less to do with theology or church structure (ecclesiology) than with something much bigger. The Reformation didn't happen in a vacuum - it occurred alongside massive cultural change. The church needed to reform to survive what was coming.

**Key Insight**: Can we even separate "church history" from "secular history" at this point? It's incredibly difficult to imagine a pre-French Revolution world where there's no separation between:
- Church and state
- Faith and science
- Poetry and pragmatism

### The Age of Enlightenment
The Reformation either:
- Led to the Age of Enlightenment, or
- Catalyzed what we refer to as the Age of Enlightenment

In either case, the two movements were interlinked and interlocked, playing off each other. The Reformation was both Protestant pushing against Catholicism AND the whole world going through "this awkward stage of pubescent Church growth."

### John Knox and the Birth of Democracy
**John Knox** founded the Presbyterian Church - a major stream of Protestantism. The key innovation:

**Presbyterian Polity**: Church governance by a presbytery (group of representatives) rather than:
- Papal hierarchy
- Priesthood pyramid
- Top-down authority structures

**Impact on Democracy**: Knox's ideas had an enormous effect on democratic thinking:
- Led to political governance based on representative democracy
- Influenced the Democratic Republic system
- While based on Roman systems, Knox shaped the application of representative leadership
- The Roman Senate was NOT representative of people the way the US Senate is

**Historical Note**: Marty mentions studying Knox in public school as a political figure more than a religious one, which makes sense given his massive political impact.

### Science Challenges Theology: The Copernican Revolution

**Nicolaus Copernicus** proposed the radical idea that the universe revolved around the sun, not the earth. Using science and mathematics, he was just "trying to be honest about the things that he was discovering."

**Why This Mattered Theologically**:
The Church's theology rested on **geocentric** understanding (earth at center):
- Different levels of "the heavens" were conceived as concentric circles
- God's dwelling place was at the outermost levels of these circles
- This wasn't just science - it was theology
- Wikipedia has an excellent visual representation of this model

**The Church's Response**:
Copernicus's **heliocentric** proposal was deemed:
- Heretical
- An attack on church teaching
- Threatening "the very existence of God himself"

The question became: "How dare Copernicus teach something through science that contradicted our theology?"

**Critical Pause for Modern Application**:
> "I hope our listeners are realizing the relevance of this conversation to our own century of Church history... It's the world we live in today. It's a world where new scientific understandings threaten our understanding of theology and the Bible. Instead of jumping to hasty conclusions, we may want to take a lesson from this chapter of history because—spoiler alert: Copernicus was right."

> "If we don't learn from these lessons of history, the next few centuries may not look back on our day with much kindness, but might see us as incredibly foolish just as we do the 16th century."

### Galileo Galilei Proves the Truth
**Galileo**, a scientific giant, championed Copernicus's cause:
- Used telescopes and mathematics
- Proved "in many ways, not just one" the validity of heliocentric universe
- The Church took more than a century to accept it
- Eventually (albeit quietly and politically), the Church made adjustments to theology and moved on

**The Pattern**: Science will not backtrack to affirm the church's status quo - quite the opposite.

### Blaise Pascal: Bridging Faith and Science
**Blaise Pascal** was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and **Catholic theologian** who:
- Made radical advances in science and mathematics
- Set the stage for Newtonian Physics
- Represented the best Catholic scholarship
- Showed that Catholic and Protestant thinkers were both advancing knowledge

**Key Insight**: While Protestantism challenged Catholicism theologically and structurally, Catholic thinkers (with "some of the best education, some of the best systems of scholasticism") were making crucial advances in mathematics, science, and art.

The Protestant Reformation and Catholic intellectual advancement moved together, with Catholicism being "pulled forward because of the challenge" from Protestantism.

### A Critical Turning Point
Marty suggests this might be "a critical moment in Church history":

**Before**: The Church pulled history forward (even in dark chapters like the Crusades)
**After Scholasticism**: Scholasticism "somehow shifts into the driver's seat" and "ever since then, the Church has been trailing behind trying to catch up, being pulled forward by the rest of that conversation."

**Question for Reflection**: What are the implications when:
- The Church starts lagging behind culture?
- We're always at war with culture's driving movement?
- versus when the Church was out front driving culture (for better or worse)?

## Historical Context and Key Events

### Scotland vs. England
Important context: The United Kingdom didn't exist yet
- England was separate from Scotland
- They had many conflicts
- Mary, Queen of Scots was the monarch during Knox's period
- Presbyterianism was the flavor of reformation in Scotland

### France and Protestantism
France was not fertile ground for the Reformation:
- Had a strong Catholic hold (remember the Avignon papacy)
- John Calvin was French but had to leave France
- Calvin ended up in Geneva (associated with Switzerland, not France)
- Protestant Huguenots in France faced persecution
- Catholicism remained dominant in France through the French Revolution

### The Awkward Growth of Faith and Science
The church moved awkwardly through the Age of Enlightenment:
- This growth curve would not end soon
- "We are still in the awkward growth phase of this era"
- "To this day, we continue to have a hard time appreciating the world of faith and science"
- "We often see those two worlds as enemies"
- "We have never truly recovered from the adversarial tone that was struck during the Age of Enlightenment"

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Presbyterian**: Church governance by presbytery (elected representatives) rather than hierarchical authority; from John Knox's Scottish reformation

**Presbytery**: A governing body of church representatives, rather than top-down papal or priestly authority

**Geocentrism**: The belief that Earth is at the center of the universe, with heavenly spheres arranged in concentric circles around it

**Heliocentrism**: The understanding that the Earth and planets revolve around the sun (proposed by Copernicus, proven by Galileo)

**Age of Enlightenment**: Period of intellectual and philosophical development emphasizing reason, science, and skepticism of traditional authority

**Ecclesiology**: The study of the church - its nature, structure, and governance

**Newtonian Physics**: System of understanding physical motion and forces developed by Isaac Newton, built on earlier work by Pascal and others

**Huguenots**: French Calvinist Protestants who faced persecution in Catholic-dominated France

## Practical Applications

### Learning from Science-Theology Conflicts
The Copernican revolution teaches us to:
- Avoid hasty conclusions when science challenges theology
- Remember that the church was wrong about geocentrism
- Consider that we might be wrong about current science-faith conflicts
- Allow scientific discovery to inform (not replace) theological understanding
- Recognize that defending wrong positions damages Christian witness

Marty's warning: "If we don't learn from these lessons of history, the next few centuries may not look back on our day with much kindness."

### Session 1 Connections
The work on Genesis 1 in BEMA Session 1 becomes crucial here:
- Genesis is not a "scientific lab report"
- There are chiasms and larger literary points
- We need room to read science textbooks and the Bible without feeling they compete
- This groundwork was essential for understanding why science-faith conflicts arise

### Appreciating Different Contributions
Both Protestant and Catholic streams contributed:
- Protestants challenged theological and ecclesiastical corruption
- Catholics advanced mathematics, science, and art
- Both were pulled forward by each other's challenges
- We shouldn't create false dichotomies

### Democratic Values
John Knox's representative governance model reminds us:
- Power concentrated at the top creates problems
- Representative systems distribute authority more justly
- These ideas come from wrestling with church structure
- Faith shaped political philosophy in positive ways

### The Church Following Culture
Consider the implications:
- What happens when the church lags behind cultural progress?
- Is the adversarial relationship between church and culture healthy?
- How can the church lead culture toward justice without dominating through empire?
- What's the difference between the church driving culture and controlling it?

## Study Questions

1. Marty claims Christianity wouldn't have survived the next 200 years without the Reformation. What does he mean? How was the Reformation tied to survival beyond just theological correction?

2. The church initially condemned Copernicus's heliocentrism as heretical. What does this teach us about current conflicts between scientific discovery and theological understanding?

3. How does the work done in BEMA Session 1 on Genesis prepare us to handle science-faith tensions better than 16th century Christians handled Copernicus?

4. John Knox's presbyterian model influenced democratic governance. What other ways has church structure shaped political philosophy? Is this influence always positive?

5. Marty suggests that after Scholasticism, "the Church has been trailing behind trying to catch up." What are the implications? Is this necessarily bad?

6. Why were Catholic scholars (like Pascal) making major advances in mathematics and science while Protestant reformers focused on theological and ecclesiastical reform? What does this tell us about different forms of contribution to human flourishing?

7. The episode notes that France wasn't fertile ground for Protestantism due to strong Catholic presence. How does political and religious context make certain reforms easier or harder?

8. "We have never truly recovered from the adversarial tone that was struck during the Age of Enlightenment" between faith and science. How do we move beyond this adversarial relationship?
