# Episode 194: AD 300-500

## Episode Metadata
- **Episode Number:** 194
- **Title:** AD 300-500
- **Season:** 5
- **Air Date:** November 5, 2020
- **Duration:** 23 minutes 41 seconds
- **Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings

## Episode Overview
This episode examines the fourth and fifth centuries, focusing on how Constantine changed Christian history and the ecumenical councils that shaped Christian orthodoxy. Marty argues that while the councils addressed important theological questions, they represent a fundamental shift away from the biblical narrative—from tikkun olam (repairing the world) and blessing nations to philosophical debates about hypostatic unions. This period marks "the beginning of a downhill slide that I'm not sure we have ever recovered from."

## Main Themes and Key Concepts

### Christendom Defined
**Christendom:** Imperial Christianity; when Christianity became an empire that spread globally
- Dominated the Western world from 3rd/4th century until the French Revolution (1,400 years)
- Brent's more positive definition: "The Church and the world are one unit"
- Marty's more critical definition: "Imperial Christianity"—Christianity as empire

### Christianity's Growth Before Constantine
- Second-fastest-growing religion in the Roman Empire for two centuries
- Fastest-growing: Mithra (Roman off-shoot of Zoroastrianism)
- By Constantine's time: More than 80% of the empire was Christian
- This sets up Marty's question from Episode 192: "Were Jesus's feet right at the door?"

### The Constantine Moment (AD 312)

**Background:**
- Constantine's father: Chlorus, who claimed to be Mithra-incarnate
- Chlorus's birthday: December 25 (the Constantinian advent celebrating his birth—origin of the date)

**The Vision at Milvian Bridge:**
- Constantine battling for strategic bridge in Rome
- If the bridge fell, Rome's fall would be imminent
- Backed against enormous odds, considering retreat, surrender, or certain death
- Vision: Christian God showed him a shield with Greek letters Chi (X) and Rho (P)
- Meaning: "In Christ, you will conquer"
- Put Chi-Rho symbol on soldiers' shields
- Went on to victory
- Constantine credited the victory to the Christian God

**Historians' Interpretations:**
1. **Completely legitimate:** Genuine conversion and vision
2. **Political genius:** Saw "writing on the wall" with 80% Christian empire; synchronized his father's Mithra worship with Christian momentum
3. **Combination:** Both political savvy and personal experience
4. **Misinterpretation:** Real vision, but Constantine totally missed what Jesus was trying to say

**Historical Significance:**
- Constantine was the last emperor with singular, full control of entire Roman Empire
- Fall of Rome still couple hundred years off, but "imminent"
- Last guy who "really had the ability to convert the entire empire in one shot"

**Marty's Assessment:**
"Who knows, was it all bad, was it all good, was it somewhere in the middle? I think he sensed that. I think he had an awareness of that."

"Nevertheless, this moment in Roman history changes the course of the Church forever. As I see it, certainly not for the better."

### What Constantine Actually Did

**Common Misconception:** Constantine made Christianity the state religion

**Reality:**
- Constantine made it LEGAL to be a Christian in the Roman Empire
- No more penalties and persecutions for Christians
- Theodosius (later in 4th century) gave incentives to those who claimed Christian faith
- Theodosius "practically made Christianity the imperial religion because it was advantageous to be one"

**The Double-Edged Sword:**
- Good: Christians didn't have to run for their lives anymore
- Problem: Ever since break-up with Jews, Christians had fallen prey to "the Gnostic Crisis"
  - Inaccurate theology
  - While struggling to stay alive, these theological issues stayed on back burner
  - Now free to return to lives of normalcy, these issues took center stage

### The Gnostic Crisis Returns

**The Problem with Gnosticism:**
- Everything spiritual = good
- Everything physical = bad (not good)
- Therefore: Was Jesus a man? (Feels dangerous to affirm in Gnostic worldview)
- Was Jesus God? Was he both?
- "That's actually really complicated now that you're no longer running for your life"

**Philosophical Paradigm:**
- Greeks and their philosophy
- Hellenism and logic dominating thought
- "Was Jesus God? Was Jesus man?" This philosophy is raging and taking over Christian thought

**Why This Became Acute:**
1. **Loss of Jewish training:** Jews received word from Sinai, then 40 years to learn what it means; Christians don't have that time/experience
2. **Loss of Jewish adoption:** No longer being adopted into family with experience
3. **Flood of convenience converts:** Gentiles flooding in because it's "convenient, efficient, effective, advantageous"—not really wanting the way of Jesus
4. **Didache abandoned:** Used to swear off old Gentile pagan ways, die to paganism, walk into Jewish family—"Now it's becoming... watered down"

**Christianity as a Fad:**
- Professor Lisa Vitel: Christianity was "a fad among the Roman elite"
- "I can use this to position myself higher in the Roman imperial hierarchy"
- Power and privilege changed the landscape entirely

## The Four Major Ecumenical Councils

**Context:** Two centuries of councils (church meetings to make decisions)
- The Jerusalem Council (Acts) showed councils could work
- But now "divorced from its Jewish backbone of truth and text and binding and loosing"
- Seven major councils total; four stand out historically

**Marty's Disclaimer:** "I'm definitely going to be oversimplifying... You're going to be very upset... I'm not going to get the exact nuances just right... That's great. That's wonderful. Remember, that's not the point of what we're doing here."

### 1. Council of Nicea (AD 325)
- **Topic:** The divinity of Christ
- **Ordered by:** Constantine
- **Heresy Addressed:** Arianism (belief that Christ is separate from God the Father; of different substance)
- **Outcome:** First draft of Nicene Creed—Christ is "of one substance with the Father"
- **Declaration:** Arianism is heresy

### 2. Council of Constantinople (AD 381)
- **Topic:** The humanity of Christ
- **Ordered by:** Theodosius I
- **Heresy Addressed:** Apollinaris (belief that Christ was not truly human)
- **Outcome:** Expanded the Nicene Creed, adding adjustments
- **Declaration:** Apollinarian doctrine added to list of heresies

### 3. Council of Ephesus (AD 431)
- **Topic:** The singularity of Christ's personhood
- **Called by:** Theodosius II
- **Heresy Addressed:** Nestorius (taught Christ was two distinct "persons"—God in one person, man in the other)
- **Outcome:** Christ declared one person at all times
- **Additional Declaration:** No one allowed to publish teachings rivaling declared orthodoxy
- **Side Conversation:** Rejected Pelagius (who rejected original sin and human depravity); adopted Augustinian theology (accepted human depravity)

### 4. Council of Chalcedon (AD 451)
- **Topic:** The fullness of divinity and humanity in Christ
- **Convoked by:** Marcian (different from Marcion the heretic)
- **Question:** Is Christ 50% God/50% man? 60%/40%? How does it work?
- **Heresy Addressed:** Eutychian heresy (Christ not completely God AND completely man simultaneously)
- **Outcome:** Hypostatic Union—Christ is simultaneously 100% God AND 100% man at the same time
- **Summary of All Four:**
  1. Was Christ God? Yes.
  2. Was Christ human? Yes.
  3. Two persons or one? One person.
  4. What percentage? 100% God, 100% human, simultaneously.

## Theological and Historical Insights

### Have We Lost the Plot?

**Marty's Ambivalence:**
"If this all sounds just a bit ridiculous, as if we've lost the plot of the story, I would say, yes, and I would say, no."

**Yes, It Matters:**
- "These theological issues are actually very significant. They matter quite a bit."
- We're familiar with these concepts today because of the councils
- Important doctrinal clarifications

**No, We've Lost the Plot:**
"It does feel on some level as though we've lost the plot of God's great narrative that we studied all throughout four sessions of our podcast, like:
- Blessing all nations
- Being put at the crossroads of the earth
- Tikkun olam and repairing of the world
- Everything we learned about rabbinic teaching
- The Kingdom of God
- Euangelion

And now we're arguing about hypostatic unions."

**The Shift:**
"This orthodoxy has become about ideas and philosophy and intellect, and affirming a set of beliefs rather than a way that we live and something that we're working out."

**The Counterfactual:**
"Would this have all been necessary if we hadn't lost touch with our text, and the methodology of relationship with God as we had understood for 1,000 years prior through our Jewish brothers and sisters through Judaism? We understood the narrative of God, if we hadn't let Gnostic ideas invade our faith, would this have been necessary?"

### The Downhill Slide

**Marty's Verdict:**
"This is the beginning of a downhill slide that I'm not sure we have ever recovered from—spoiler alert, Session 5 spoiler alert—I'm not sure we ever recovered from this."

"I do have hope, however. But we'll get to that later."

### The Fall of Rome (Late 5th Century)

**Not a Surprise:**
- Writing was on the wall
- Original strength of Empire disappeared even before Constantine
- Romans in constant flux and political instability
- Hard to find singular leader to consolidate power
- Kept getting splintered and fractured
- Division became its downfall

**Gospel Parallel:**
- When Herod the Great died, kingdom split into three parts
- "That's exactly what happened to Rome, overall"

**Result:**
- Roman Empire loses vastness of reach
- Becomes the Byzantine Empire (next episode's focus)

## Practical Applications

### Recognizing Orthodoxy vs. Orthopraxy Imbalance
- Orthodoxy (right belief) became primary focus
- Orthopraxy (right practice)—blessing nations, tikkun olam—faded to background
- Modern application: Do we focus more on doctrinal statements than on living out the Kingdom?

### The Danger of Power and Privilege
- Constantine's "conversion" brought freedom from persecution (good)
- But also flood of convenience converts (bad)
- Christianity became "advantageous"—fad among Roman elite
- When faith becomes fashionable, substance can be lost

### Gnostic Dualism in Modern Church
Check for spirit/body divide in your own thinking:
- Do we elevate "spiritual" ministry over physical service?
- Do we separate worship from justice work?
- Do we value ideas/intellect over embodied practice?
- Have we absorbed Hellenistic philosophy over Hebraic wholeness?

### The Importance of Grounding in Text
Without Jewish connection to Text:
- Gentile Christianity defaulted to philosophical speculation
- Lost narrative framework (Torah, prophets, wisdom, history)
- Shifted from "way of life" to "set of beliefs"

## Study Questions

1. Was Constantine's conversion genuine, politically calculated, or both? Does it matter? How do his motives affect how we should view the Constantinian shift?

2. Marty says Constantine's changes were "certainly not for the better." Do you agree? What might have been better about remaining a persecuted minority faith?

3. How do we hold the tension Marty identifies: the theological issues in the councils "matter quite a bit" AND "we've lost the plot of the story"?

4. In what ways does modern evangelical Christianity focus on "affirming a set of beliefs rather than a way that we live"?

5. If we hadn't separated from Jewish roots and Gnostic ideas hadn't invaded the faith, would the ecumenical councils have been necessary? What does this suggest about the relationship between practice and theology?

6. How do we see the "convenience convert" phenomenon in contemporary Western Christianity? What does it look like when Christianity is "advantageous"?

7. The Didache required converts to "swear off" old pagan ways and be adopted into a Jewish walk. What would a modern equivalent look like? What are we asking people to swear off?

8. How can we recover the balance between orthodoxy (right belief) and orthopraxy (right practice)?

## Closing Thoughts

This episode presents the Constantinian shift as profoundly ambiguous. On one hand, freedom from persecution is good. The theological clarifications of the councils matter. On the other hand, something essential was lost.

When Christianity became legal, then advantageous, then imperial, it lost its character. The flood of convenience converts diluted the commitment required by the Didache. The Church shifted from a way of life (orthopraxy) to a set of beliefs (orthodoxy). Philosophy replaced narrative. Hypostatic unions replaced tikkun olam.

Marty's critique is devastating: "This is the beginning of a downhill slide that I'm not sure we have ever recovered from." Yet he holds hope—"but we'll get to that later."

The councils addressed real questions forced by Gnostic influence. But Marty asks the counterfactual: Would these questions even have arisen if we hadn't separated from Jewish roots? If we had maintained connection to Text and the "methodology of relationship with God as we had understood for 1,000 years"?

The councils gave us orthodox Christology. But we lost the plot of God's great narrative. We gained philosophical precision. But we lost embodied practice. We secured correct doctrine. But we abandoned the mission of blessing all nations.

As Rome fell and became the Byzantine Empire, the church was transformed from a persecuted minority movement focused on the way of Jesus into Christendom—imperial Christianity, focused on affirming correct beliefs about Jesus.

The question hanging over the rest of Session 5: Can we recover what was lost? Or has the downhill slide become irreversible?

"I do have hope, however. But we'll get to that later."
