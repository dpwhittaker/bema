# Chapter 1: The Story We Tell

## Introduction: Standing at the Edge

Before we can understand where we are, we must know where we have been. Before we can trace the winding path of two thousand years of Christian history, we must first remember the story that brought us here.

This is not merely an academic exercise. How we approach history matters as much as the history itself. Every historian tells a story. Every account of the past carries the fingerprints of the one who tells it---their culture, their convictions, their hopes and fears. The biblical writers understood this. They placed their historical books not in the "Writings" but among the "Prophets," because they understood that recording history is itself a prophetic act. To tell the story of the past is to be a mouthpiece for what God wants His people to understand.

So before we step into the murky waters of church history---a realm where we no longer have the clarity of God-breathed Scripture to guide us---let us first stand on solid ground. Let us remember the story that started it all.

## The Arc of Scripture: A Story of Partnership

The story begins with partnership.

In Genesis, we meet the characters: a Creator who speaks worlds into existence and a creation that He loves. God forms humanity not as servants or subjects, but as partners in the work of tending His good world. "Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky'" (Genesis 1:26, NIV). This is the basis of everything that follows---a God who desires relationship, who invites participation, who refuses to work alone.

Exodus brings the formal choosing. God looks upon a nation of slaves in Egypt and declares, "I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God" (Exodus 6:7, NIV). But this is no forced arrangement. It is a marriage covenant, a mutual choosing. God chooses Israel; Israel chooses God. At Sinai, the vows are exchanged, and a partnership is sealed.

Leviticus may seem like a tedious collection of laws to modern readers, but its purpose is profound: defining what the partnership will look like. How do a holy God and a flawed people live together? What rhythms of life, what patterns of worship, what boundaries and freedoms will shape their shared existence?

Numbers takes us into the wilderness, where the partner is shaped. Forty years of wandering are not punishment but formation. In the crucible of the desert, slaves become a nation, individuals become a people, and chaos becomes community.

Then Deuteronomy calls the people to remember. Before they cross into the promised land, Moses stands before them and recites everything---every deliverance, every law, every moment of failure and grace. "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you" (Deuteronomy 15:15, NIV), he pleads. The partnership can only survive if we remember what it was built upon.

## The Long Struggle: Redemption's Cycle

What follows is a thousand years of struggle.

Joshua plants God's people at the crossroads of the ancient world. This is no accident. Israel is not meant to be a nation among nations, minding its own business in some forgotten corner of the map. They are positioned at the intersection of every major trade route, every migrating army, every cultural current. They cannot help but be noticed. As Isaiah would later proclaim, they are meant to be "a light for the Gentiles, that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth" (Isaiah 49:6, NIV).

But the light flickers. Judges and Ruth tell the story of a people who cannot seem to find their footing. They spiral through cycles of faithfulness and failure, victory and defeat. They beg for a king like the other nations have, not realizing that what makes them unique is precisely that they are not like the other nations.

Samuel and Kings chronicle the monarchy---Saul's jealousy, David's heart, Solomon's wisdom and folly. The kingdom splits. The northern tribes are scattered by Assyria. The southern kingdom holds on longer, but not forever.

By the time we reach Chronicles, something has gone terribly wrong. Israel has become the anti-story. They were called to bless all nations, but now they only bless themselves. They were called to be different from empire, but now they have become empire. Injustice takes root wherever people forget that they exist for others.

## Tools for the Journey

In the midst of all this struggle---both the triumphs and the tragedies---God provides tools for survival.

The Psalms give voice to every human emotion. Here is worship that does not demand you put on a happy face, that makes room for lament and rage and doubt alongside praise. Here is art for the journey, songs for the wilderness, poetry for the soul.

Proverbs offers nuggets of conventional wisdom---the practical insights that help ordinary people navigate ordinary days. Not every moment requires prophetic revelation; sometimes we just need to know how to live.

Ecclesiastes wrestles with meaning itself. "Meaningless! Meaningless! Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless" (Ecclesiastes 1:2, NIV), cries the Teacher, and yet he keeps searching. This book gives us permission to question, to wrestle, to refuse easy answers. It also gives us a reason to get up each morning even when the answers remain elusive.

Song of Songs celebrates embodied love, reminding us that the God who created bodies also delights in them. Intimacy, passion, relationship---these are not distractions from the spiritual life but expressions of it.

## The Prophetic Voice

When the people lose their way, God sends prophets.

Before the exile, the prophets warn. Amos thunders against those who "sell the innocent for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals" (Amos 2:6, NIV). Hosea marries a prostitute to demonstrate God's faithful love for an unfaithful people. Isaiah sees "the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne" and cries out, "Woe to me! I am ruined!" (Isaiah 6:1, 5, NIV). These voices cry out in the wilderness: "Turn back! It is not too late!"

When the people refuse to listen, the prophets pronounce woe. Jeremiah weeps over Jerusalem. Habakkuk demands to know why God allows injustice. The pronouncements are devastating, but even in judgment there is a door left open.

After the exile, when the people sit by the rivers of Babylon and weep, the prophets bring hope. Ezekiel sees a valley of dry bones and hears God declare, "I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD" (Ezekiel 37:6, NIV). Daniel survives the lion's den. Even Job, in his suffering, encounters the God who speaks from the whirlwind. The prophets insist: God is not finished.

## Return and Renewal

Eventually, Cyrus the Great allows God's people to return home. But home is not what it used to be.

Ezra and Nehemiah lead the work of rebuilding---the walls, the temple, the community itself. Haggai and Zechariah yearn for the glory of the former days. But Malachi knows that those days are gone. This new world demands a new approach. The exile has changed everything.

What follows is often called the "silent years," but they are anything but silent. In these centuries between the testaments, the synagogue is born. The Jewish people, scattered across the known world, develop a new model for community and education. They become a people of the Book in ways they had never been before. The Text moves from scroll to heart.

But something else is happening during these centuries. A foreign philosophy is sweeping across the world, reshaping how people think about everything. The Greeks call it *paideia*---education, culture, the cultivation of the ideal human. We call it Hellenism.

Hellenism places humanity at the center of all things. "Man is the measure of all things," said Protagoras, and the Greek world believed him. This stands in stark contrast to the psalmist's declaration: "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands" (Psalm 19:1, NIV). This is a direct collision with the biblical worldview, which insists that God is the measure of all things. Where the Bible teaches self-sacrifice for the sake of others, Hellenism teaches self-preservation. Where the Bible envisions shalom---the flourishing of all creation---Hellenism envisions empire.

God's people are caught between two worlds, and they respond in different ways. Some, like the Sadducees, make corrupt alliances with power. Others, like the Herodians, compromise in more subtle ways. The Essenes withdraw entirely, preserving purity at the cost of engagement. The Pharisees become zealous for obedience but lose compassion in the pursuit of righteousness. The Zealots take up the weapons of empire to fight empire, not realizing that the means have become the ends.

Into this fractured world, a baby is born in Bethlehem.

## The Story in Flesh

Jesus is not simply a teacher who came to correct some theological errors. He is the entire biblical narrative walking among us. As he himself declared, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them" (Matthew 5:17, NIV). Every story, every law, every prophecy---they all find their fulfillment in him.

Matthew reveals Jesus as God's commitment to the outcast. Mark announces to Rome that there is a King above Caesar. Luke weaves Jesus into the weekly rhythm of Torah readings, showing how every portion points to him. John proclaims to the Greco-Roman world that "the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14, NIV), that the God of Israel is grafting the nations into His ancient story.

The Gospels are not four different versions of the same story; they are four portraits of the same person, each painted for a different audience, each revealing something that the others do not capture alone.

## The Movement Begins

After the resurrection, after Pentecost, the movement begins.

Acts is the epilogue of one story and the prologue of another. What happens when the Kingdom of God, empowered by the Spirit, collides with the Kingdom of Empire? The answer fills the pages of this remarkable book. The people of God remember their original calling: to bless all nations, not just themselves. A very Jewish church steps into a very Gentile world, and everything changes.

The letters of Paul take ancient truth and apply it to new contexts. What does it mean to follow Jesus in Corinth, where temple prostitution is normal? In Philippi, a Roman colony obsessed with citizenship? In Galatia, where false teachers are demanding circumcision? The answers are never one-size-fits-all. Each context demands fresh wisdom, fresh application, fresh discernment.

Hebrews calls Jewish believers to persevere when the temple lies in ruins and the old ways seem lost forever. James insists that "faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26, NIV), that the commandments are not burdens but the path to life. Peter calls his readers to holy living as God's chosen people, scattered across a hostile world. John reduces everything to its essence: love. "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love" (1 John 4:8, NIV). Jude draws on ancient traditions---even texts outside the biblical canon---to call God's people to faithfulness.

And then comes Revelation, using every tool in the prophetic toolbox to illuminate present experience with past story. The imagery is strange to modern readers, but to first-century believers steeped in the Tanakh, it was a symphony of familiar themes. The dragon is still thrashing, but his defeat is certain. The Lamb is still on the throne. The new Jerusalem is coming.

## The Feet at the Door

This brings us to the threshold of our story.

By the end of the first century, the Jesus movement had spread like wildfire across the Roman Empire. The most powerful civilization in history was beginning to crumble, and this ragtag band of disciples seemed to be winning. The radical obedience of early believers---their refusal to bow to Caesar, their care for the poor, their communities that crossed every boundary of class and ethnicity---was actually working.

The early Christians believed Jesus was coming back soon. Within years, not centuries. And we often look back at them and shake our heads. "They were wrong," we say. "Two thousand years later, we're still waiting."

But what if they were not wrong?

What if the return of Christ is not a fixed date on God's calendar but something that stands in relation to us? The apostle Peter wrote that we should "live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming" (2 Peter 3:11-12, NIV). Speed its coming. The Greek is unmistakable. Our obedience somehow participates in the timing of God's ultimate redemption.

This is the Jewish concept of *tikkun olam*---repairing the world. When we engage in righteousness, when we partner with God in restoration, when we live as if the Kingdom is already here, we are not simply waiting for heaven. We are helping to bring it.

The early church understood this. Their radical commitment to the way of Jesus was bending the arc of history toward its intended goal. The empire was tottering. The age to come was drawing near. Jesus's feet were at the door.

And then something happened.

## A Different Kind of History

Before we discover what that "something" was, we must acknowledge something important about the journey ahead.

When we studied the Bible together, we had the authority of Scripture beneath our feet. We could lean on rabbinic wisdom, on archaeological evidence, on centuries of careful scholarship. But now we are entering different territory. Church history is the realm of human interpretation, of biased accounts, of winners writing the story of the losers.

This does not mean we should avoid it. The question "What happened between Revelation and today?" is too important to ignore. But we must approach it with humility, knowing that every historian---including this one---tells a story shaped by their own perspective.

The Jewish people understood this. They placed the historical books of Samuel and Kings among the Prophets because they knew that to record history is to engage in prophecy. It is to select which events matter, which characters deserve attention, which lessons must be drawn. The Chronicles tell the same history from a different angle, with a different prophetic purpose. Both are true. Both are incomplete.

So as we venture into the murky waters of church history, we carry three essential understandings:

First, we are not professional historians with credentials and dissertations. We are fellow travelers trying to understand how we got here.

Second, all history is storytelling. Every account is shaped by the teller's context, convictions, and blind spots. Be suspicious of anyone who claims pure objectivity.

Third, we are not trying to cover everything. We will paint with broad strokes, oversimplify complex movements, and frustrate those who have devoted their lives to studying these periods in depth. That's acceptable. Our goal is not comprehensive coverage. Our goal is to understand how the Text applies to our lives today.

## The Text at the Center

This last point deserves special emphasis.

The name "BEMA" comes from the raised platform in the center of the synagogue where the Scriptures were read. It symbolizes our commitment to keeping the Text at the heart of everything we do. We are not studying church history because we are fascinated by church history (though it is fascinating). We are studying it because we cannot fully understand the Bible without understanding what happened between then and now.

Many Christians dive into church history looking for direction, meaning, and identity. They become obsessed with the Reformers or the Desert Fathers or the Early Church Fathers, searching for a golden age to reclaim. But the Bible was always meant to be our source of direction, meaning, and identity. Church history helps us understand how to apply the Text; it is not a replacement for the Text.

So as we turn to examine what happened after Revelation---the schisms and councils, the empires and reformations, the triumphs and catastrophes---we do so with our feet firmly planted on the BEMA. The Text remains central. History is the context that helps us understand it.

## The Question Before Us

We began with the story of Scripture, that great arc from Genesis to Revelation. We traced the themes of partnership and struggle, exile and return, prophecy and fulfillment. We watched as a Jewish rabbi from Nazareth embodied the entire narrative and sent his followers to bring it to the world. We saw the early church, empowered by the Spirit, spreading across the empire with such force that Rome itself was crumbling.

The age to come was near. The kingdom was advancing. The radical obedience of those first believers was speeding the return of their Lord.

And then something happened.

The next chapter will tell us what that something was. It will take us into the second century, to a moment of betrayal that fractured the church from its Jewish roots and set in motion consequences we are still living with today.

But before we go there, let this truth settle in: We are still part of this story. The arc that began in Genesis continues through us. The partnership God established with Abraham runs through our veins. The mission to bless all nations remains our calling.

History is not simply what happened to other people long ago. It is the story of how we became who we are. And if we understand it rightly, it may show us who we are meant to become.

The feet of Jesus are still at the door. The question is whether we have the courage to live as if that were true.
