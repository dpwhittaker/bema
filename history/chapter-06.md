# Chapter 6: Seeds of Reform

When the dust of the Crusades finally settled, Christendom surveyed what remained and discovered it was broken.

The grand military campaigns had accomplished almost nothing of lasting value. Jerusalem had changed hands repeatedly and would eventually remain under Muslim control. The crusader kingdoms had risen and fallen. The Eastern and Western churches were more divided than ever after the catastrophe of the Fourth Crusade. Hundreds of thousands of people were dead.

And the Church was bankrupt.

Two centuries of warfare had drained the treasuries of Europe. Kings and popes had spent everything they had, borrowed more than they could repay, and now faced the impossible task of rebuilding shattered institutions without resources to do so. The Church needed money desperately, and in that desperate need lay the seeds of terrible corruption.

But also, as we shall see, the seeds of necessary reform.

## The Age of Indulgences

In a medieval world where most people could not read, where the Bible existed only in Latin, where priests were often the only educated figures in a village, the common people depended entirely on their clergy to tell them what God wanted and how to receive God's grace.

This dependence created opportunity for abuse.

The Church had long taught that believers interacted with God's grace through the sacraments: baptism, the Eucharist, confession, marriage, and others. These practices were not originally understood as transactional exchanges but as means by which God's grace flowed into daily life. A person confessing sins and receiving absolution experienced God's forgiveness, not as something purchased, but as a gift received through faithful practice.

But in the desperate financial conditions following the Crusades, something shifted. The narrative of God became, in the hands of corrupt leaders, a tool for enslaving people in a system of fear, guilt, and control.

At its worst, the Church began offering forgiveness at a monetary price.

Come to confession. Go through the motions. Make a monetary offering. Receive absolution. The system had a name: indulgences. And it represented one of the most profound distortions of the Gospel in Christian history.

The logic was simple and devastating. People believed their eternal destinies hung in the balance. They believed the Church held the keys to heaven and hell. They believed that failing to receive proper absolution meant suffering in purgatory or worse. And they believed the priests who told them that a monetary gift could secure their salvation.

The poor, who could barely afford to eat, scraped together coins to buy forgiveness. The dying, terrified of what awaited them, paid for assurance of heaven. The grieving, worried about deceased relatives suffering in purgatory, purchased relief for the dead.

The Church grew wealthy. The people grew poorer. And the Gospel of grace became a commodity for sale.

## A System of Fear, Guilt, and Control

We must pause here to understand what was happening at a deeper level.

The sacramental system, in its original intent, was not about control. Early Christian thinkers understood the sacraments as genuine encounters with grace, ways of experiencing God's presence in the ordinary rhythms of life. A baby baptized was welcomed into community. A couple married was blessed by God and witnesses. A sinner confessing was restored to fellowship. These were beautiful practices rooted in real theology.

But any system that mediates between people and God contains within it the potential for abuse. When priests become gatekeepers of grace, when ordinary people cannot access Scripture for themselves, when the uneducated must trust the educated to tell them truth, the conditions exist for manipulation.

The age of indulgences revealed what happens when that manipulation becomes systematic. The Church had become an institution that controlled access to God. It told people they needed the Church's mediation to be forgiven, and then it charged money for that mediation. It used fear of hell to generate revenue. It used guilt about sin to maintain power. It used people's deepest longings and terrors as tools for institutional preservation.

This was not the Gospel. This was Empire wearing religious garments.

And yet, even in this darkness, something remarkable persisted.

## There's Always a Remnant

Even in the worst corruption, there's always a remnant. As God told Elijah when he despaired of being alone, "I have reserved seven thousand in Israel---all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal" (1 Kings 19:18, NIV).

Not every priest was corrupt. Not every bishop was selling forgiveness. Scattered throughout the medieval Church were faithful leaders who maintained sound doctrine, modeled self-sacrificial life, and instilled hope in the people they served.

These faithful servants did not have the power to reform the institution from within. They were often marginalized, sometimes persecuted. But they kept the flame alive. They remembered what the Gospel was supposed to be about. They loved the people in their care and refused to exploit them.

This is a crucial pattern to remember as we trace the arc of Christian history. The institution may become corrupt, but the institution is not the whole story. Within every generation, there are those who remember a better way. There are those who refuse to sell what should be given freely. There are those who follow Jesus even when following Jesus puts them at odds with the official Church.

The remnant rarely makes headlines. They do not build empires or win wars or accumulate wealth. But they preserve something precious through the dark years, and when the time for reform finally comes, they provide the foundation on which renewal can be built.

## John Wycliffe: Scripture for the People

One voice crying for reform emerged from England in the fourteenth century. His name was John Wycliffe, and his passion was simple: the people needed access to Scripture.

Wycliffe looked at a Church that kept the Bible locked away in Latin, a language the common people could not read, and he saw a fundamental injustice. How could people follow God's word if they could not know God's word? As Jesus had said, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4, NIV). How could they discern truth from manipulation if they had no access to truth for themselves?

He began attacking the imperial privilege of the Church. He despised the separation between clergy and laypeople, the vast gulf between educated priests and ignorant parishioners. He argued against the pomp and hierarchy that lifted religious leaders above those they served.

But most importantly, he committed himself to translation. Wycliffe believed that Scripture should not be held captive in an ancient language. The people needed the Bible in their own tongue, in words they could understand and apply to their own lives.

Wycliffe produced the first complete English translation of the Bible. It was translated from the Latin Vulgate rather than from the original Hebrew and Greek, so it was not perfect. But it was revolutionary. For the first time, English-speaking people could hear the Scriptures in their own language.

The Church declared Wycliffe a heretic. His writings were banned. His followers, called Lollards, were persecuted. But the idea could not be suppressed: the people of God should have access to the word of God.

Wycliffe died of natural causes, but the Church was not satisfied. Decades after his death, the Council of Constance condemned his writings, ordered his books burned, and had his bones exhumed and burned as well. That is how threatening his ideas were to the institutional Church.

But the idea survived. The translation project survived. And today, Wycliffe Bible Translators carries on his legacy, working to put Scripture into the heart languages of people around the world.

## John Hus: A Father of Reformation

The flame that Wycliffe lit in England blazed up in Bohemia, in the region we now call the Czech Republic. There, a priest named John Hus took up the cause of reform with a passion that would cost him his life.

Hus is sometimes called a true father of the Reformation. It is hard to see his work apart from what Wycliffe had begun, but Hus took the ideas further and made them more dangerous to the established order.

Like Wycliffe, Hus attacked the corruption of the Church. Like Wycliffe, he wanted to dissolve the barriers between clergy and laity. But Hus went further: he led organized resistance to papal authority.

The Bohemian Revolt, as it came to be called, challenged the legitimacy of a corrupt papacy. Hus led movements that rejected Roman control, that demanded reform of abusive practices, that insisted the Church should serve the people rather than exploit them.

For this, he was summoned to the Council of Constance in 1415. He was promised safe conduct, guaranteed that he could speak his case and return home safely. He trusted the promise.

He should not have.

John Hus was arrested, tried for heresy, and burned at the stake. The safe conduct meant nothing. The powerful had decided he was too dangerous to live.

But his death did not end the movement. His followers continued to resist. Two successful regional crusades were launched against those who remained loyal to Rome. The Hussite Wars demonstrated that the papacy was not invincible, that faithful Christians could stand against corrupt authority and survive.

Hus used methods that we might question. He fought empire with something like empire, using military force to resist ecclesiastical tyranny. Whether this was right or wrong is a matter for moral debate. What is undeniable is that he prepared the ground for what would come a century later. Without Wycliffe and Hus, there could have been no Luther, no Zwingli, no Calvin.

The seeds of reform were being planted in blood.

## Medieval Nationalism: A Shifting World

While reformers were challenging the Church's corruption, the political landscape of Europe was transforming. A new force was emerging: nationalism.

For centuries, Europe had been organized around the idea of Christendom, a unified Christian civilization bound together under papal authority. People identified primarily as Christians, as members of a universal Church, rather than as citizens of particular nations. The Pope in Rome claimed authority over kings and emperors, and kings and emperors largely accepted that claim.

But that world was ending.

People began to identify differently. They were not just Christians; they were French Christians, German Christians, English Christians. Their loyalty to nation began to rival, and sometimes exceed, their loyalty to a foreign pope in a distant city.

This shift had profound implications. If a French king could rally his people around French identity, why should he submit to Roman authority? If a German prince could claim the allegiance of his subjects based on shared German culture, why should he let Italian clergy drain wealth from his land?

The Papacy itself reflected this fragmentation. For nearly seventy years in the fourteenth century, the papal seat moved from Rome to Avignon in France. Seven French popes ruled from French soil, and many Europeans saw this as the papacy being captured by French interests. When the papacy finally returned to Rome, rival claimants emerged. The Western Schism saw multiple popes excommunicating each other, each claiming to be the true successor of Peter.

The unified Christendom of medieval imagination was splintering. And in the cracks, room was opening for reform.

## The Reformation Finds Its Leaders

By the early sixteenth century, the Church was suffering from continuing divisions and schisms. Corruption was endemic. The abuse of indulgences had reached obscene proportions. The gap between what Jesus taught and what the Church practiced had become impossible to ignore.

The Reformation was simply waiting for good leaders.

It found them.

In Germany, Martin Luther nailed his ninety-five theses to the church door in Wittenberg, challenging the theology and practice of indulgences. His protest sparked a movement that would remake European Christianity.

In Switzerland, Ulrich Zwingli led reform in Zurich, challenging not only indulgences but the whole structure of medieval Catholic practice. His movement developed independently of Luther's but moved in similar directions.

In Geneva, John Calvin built a systematic theology of grace that would influence Protestant thought for centuries. Though French by birth, Calvin was driven from his homeland and made Geneva the center of Reformed Christianity.

Each reformer led movements in their respective lands, each with their own theological nuances, each attracting followers who saw in their teaching a recovery of biblical faith.

And each movement was shaped by the nationalism of its context. Germans became Lutheran. The French who embraced reform became Calvinist. The Swiss followed Zwingli or Calvin. Scots became Presbyterian. English became Anglican.

The unity of medieval Christendom was over. In its place arose a patchwork of national churches, each claiming to represent true Christianity, each developing its own traditions and emphases.

## The Printing Press Revolution

None of this would have been possible without a technological revolution that had occurred a few decades earlier.

Around 1440, Johannes Gutenberg developed the printing press with movable type. For the first time in history, books could be produced quickly and cheaply. Ideas could spread faster than the authorities could suppress them.

Wycliffe had translated the Bible by hand, and his followers had copied it by hand, one laborious page at a time. Luther's Bible could be printed by the thousands. A theological treatise that once took months to copy could now be distributed across a continent in weeks.

The printing press democratized knowledge. It put Scripture into the hands of common people. It allowed reformers to communicate directly with the masses rather than relying on ecclesiastical channels.

Consider the translation work that followed. Wycliffe had translated from Latin to English. Erasmus assembled Greek texts of the New Testament, making the original language available. William Tyndale translated from that Greek into English, producing the translation that would eventually become the King James Bible. Luther translated into German, giving the German people Scripture in their own tongue.

Each translation represented a theological act. The translators had to make choices about how to render Greek and Hebrew words, and those choices reflected their theological convictions. Different Protestant traditions gravitated toward different translations. But all of them shared one conviction: the people should have the Bible in their own language.

The priesthood of all believers was not just a theological slogan. It was becoming practical reality. If all believers could read Scripture for themselves, if all believers could encounter God's word directly, then the medieval system of clerical mediation was no longer necessary.

The gap between educated clergy and uneducated laity was closing. The Reformation was not just about changing doctrine. It was about changing access.

---

## Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy

The Reformation changed the face of education. As Protestant churches invested in teaching people to read, as they translated Scripture and catechisms into common languages, as they insisted that faith was the responsibility of every believer, literacy spread.

Both orthodoxy (right belief) and orthopraxy (right practice) became the work of the whole body, not just the specialists. Luther's famous phrase, "the priesthood of all believers," captured the revolution. Every Christian was called to know the faith and live the faith, not merely to receive it passively from professional clergy.

This was good. This recovered something that had been lost when Christianity became the religion of empire. In the early church, before Constantine, believers learned the faith through apprenticeship. They watched and imitated. They were formed in community. The medieval system had replaced that formation with sacramental transaction mediated by specialists.

The Reformation returned agency to ordinary believers. It insisted that faith was not something done to you but something you participated in actively.

But there were losses as well. The Reformation's emphasis on correct doctrine sometimes overshadowed the ancient emphasis on spiritual formation. The debates between Protestant groups could become bitter and divisive, as each claimed to possess the true interpretation of Scripture. The unity of the Church, already fractured between East and West, fragmented into hundreds of competing denominations.

We gained access. We gained agency. We gained Scripture in our own languages. But we also gained the capacity for endless argument, for schism after schism, for defining ourselves against each other rather than together.

## The Change Is Only Beginning

While this might seem like an unbelievable amount of change for the world to endure, the change was only beginning.

The Reformation opened doors that could never be closed again. Once people had access to Scripture, they would read it for themselves and form their own conclusions. Once the authority of Rome was successfully challenged, every authority became challengeable. Once nationalism shaped religious identity, political and religious history would be inseparable.

The seeds planted by Wycliffe and Hus, watered by Luther and Calvin, would grow into a forest that would transform the entire Western world. The next centuries would see revolutions political and scientific, intellectual and social, each building on what the Reformation had begun.

But that is the story of the next chapters. For now, we must sit with what the Reformation achieved and what it cost.

It recovered the centrality of Scripture. It challenged corrupt authority. It gave ordinary believers access to the word of God in their own languages. It insisted that faith was not something purchased but something received freely by grace---"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith---and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8, NIV).

These were genuine recoveries. These were seeds that would bear good fruit.

But the Reformation also fragmented the visible Church. It tied religious identity to national identity in ways that would prove problematic. It generated conflicts that would claim millions of lives in the wars of religion that followed. It set patterns of division that continue to multiply to this day.

## The Remnant Remembered

In the end, what the Reformation reminds us is that there is always a remnant.

When the Church becomes corrupt, when leaders exploit the people they should serve, when the Gospel is distorted into a tool of control, there are always those who remember a better way. There are always voices crying out for justice. There are always Wycliffes translating and Hussites resisting and eventually Luthers posting their protests on church doors.

Empire cannot win forever. Corruption eventually produces its own opposition. The seeds of reform are always being planted, often in soil that seems hopelessly barren.

This should give us hope. Whatever failures the Church faces today, whatever corruptions we must confront, we are not alone. We stand in a long line of reformers who refused to accept that what is must always be what is.

But it should also give us humility. The Reformation was necessary precisely because the Church had failed so badly. The age of indulgences happened because Christians allowed it to happen. The exploitation of the poor occurred within institutions that claimed to represent Jesus.

The seeds of reform grow from the soil of failure. May we have the wisdom to learn from both.
