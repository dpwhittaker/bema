# Chapter 7: Faith Meets Science

Here is a claim that may surprise you: Without the Reformation, Christianity would not have survived the next two hundred years.

This statement has less to do with theology than you might expect. Luther's insights about grace and faith were important, but they were not the primary reason the Reformation was essential for Christian survival. Something much larger was happening, something that would have crushed an unreformed medieval Church.

The world was changing in ways that would challenge every assumption about faith, authority, and the nature of reality itself. The Reformation did not cause this change, but it prepared Christianity to survive it. Just barely.

Welcome to the age when faith met science.

## The World Before Separation

Before we can understand what happened, we need to understand what the world looked like before it happened. And this requires an imaginative leap that is surprisingly difficult.

We live in a world where church and state are separate, where faith and science occupy different domains, where a person can be devoutly religious and completely secular at the same time, compartmentalizing beliefs into Sunday boxes that need not affect Monday through Saturday.

This world did not exist before the French Revolution. It was literally inconceivable.

In the medieval world, everything was connected. The king derived his authority from God. The Church blessed the state, and the state enforced the Church's teachings. Science was a branch of theology, mathematics a path to understanding divine order. Poetry and pragmatism were not opposed; they were different ways of approaching the same unified reality.

There was no separation because there was nothing to separate. The world was one thing: creation, ordered by God, known through a combination of revelation and reason that were themselves aspects of the same truth.

The Reformation cracked this unity by challenging the Church's authority. But the scientific revolution would shatter it entirely.

## Ptolemy's Universe

For over a thousand years, the Western world understood the cosmos through the model developed by the ancient astronomer Ptolemy. The earth sat fixed at the center of the universe. Around it revolved crystalline spheres carrying the moon, the sun, the planets, and finally the stars. Beyond the outermost sphere lay the heavens, the realm of God.

This was not merely scientific theory. It was theology.

The concentric circles of the heavens represented the hierarchy of creation. Earth, made of base matter, sat at the bottom. Above it, in ascending order of perfection, rose the celestial spheres. God dwelt in the highest heaven, from which divine influence descended through the spheres to affect earthly events.

The medieval Church built its cosmology on this foundation. The liturgy assumed it. The architecture reflected it. The great cathedrals pointed upward toward the heavens, toward God who watched from the outermost sphere. Scripture itself seemed to confirm it: the sun stopped for Joshua---"The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day" (Joshua 10:13, NIV)---and "the heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1, NIV), while everywhere in the Bible the earth appeared stable and the heavenly bodies moved around it.

Geocentrism, the belief that earth stands at the center, was not just science. It was theology. It was metaphysics. It was the assumed framework that made sense of everything else.

And it was wrong.

## Copernicus Looks Up

Nicolaus Copernicus was not trying to cause trouble. He was a mathematician and astronomer, a canon of the Catholic Church, a man of deep faith who believed that studying the heavens was a way of knowing the Creator.

But as he studied the movements of the planets, the mathematics did not work. The Ptolemaic model, with its complex system of epicycles (circles upon circles to explain planetary motion), grew ever more convoluted as observations grew more precise. Something was wrong.

Copernicus proposed a radical solution: perhaps the earth was not the center after all. Perhaps the sun stood at the center, and the earth and other planets revolved around it.

He was just trying to be honest about what he was discovering.

The implications were staggering. If the earth was not the center, if it was just another planet orbiting the sun, then the entire medieval cosmology collapsed. The concentric spheres made no sense. The hierarchy of creation made no sense. The assumed framework of a thousand years of theology made no sense.

The Church understood the threat. Copernicus's heliocentric proposal was not merely a scientific hypothesis. It was an attack on theology itself. It seemed to undermine the very existence of God, who was supposed to dwell beyond the outermost sphere of a geocentric universe.

The Church declared heliocentrism heretical. And Copernicus, knowing the danger of his ideas, delayed publication of his work until he was on his deathbed.

## A Lesson for Today

I want to pause here, because we are approaching a turning point that has never stopped turning. The events of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are not merely historical. They are alive. They are happening again, right now.

Consider our current situation. New scientific understandings regularly challenge traditional theological interpretations. Evolution challenges certain readings of Genesis. Cosmology challenges assumptions about the age of the universe. Neuroscience challenges assumptions about the soul. Genetics and psychology challenge assumptions about human nature.

And Christians are divided about how to respond. Some retreat into denial, insisting that the science must be wrong because it contradicts their interpretation of Scripture. Others abandon faith entirely, concluding that if science and the Bible conflict, then the Bible must be false. Still others search for more nuanced positions, arguing that the conflict is not between science and Scripture but between science and certain interpretations of Scripture.

This exact conversation happened five hundred years ago. And we should pay very close attention to how it turned out.

Spoiler alert: Copernicus was right.

The earth does revolve around the sun. The geocentric model was wrong. The Church's theological interpretations based on that model were wrong. And after much resistance and suffering, Christianity eventually adapted and survived.

If we do not learn from these lessons of history, the next few centuries may not look back on our day with much kindness. They may see us as incredibly foolish, just as we see the sixteenth century.

## Galileo Proves the Truth

The tension between heliocentrism and the Church came to a head with Galileo Galilei.

Galileo was a scientific giant. He improved the telescope to the point where he could observe the heavens in unprecedented detail. He saw the moons of Jupiter orbiting their planet, proving that not everything revolved around the earth. He observed the phases of Venus, which only made sense in a heliocentric model. He gathered evidence upon evidence, not just one proof but many.

Galileo championed Copernicus's cause. He published his findings. He argued publicly that the earth moved around the sun.

And the Church silenced him.

In 1616, the Inquisition declared heliocentrism "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical." Galileo was warned to abandon his views. When he continued to teach and publish, he was tried by the Inquisition, forced to recant, and spent the rest of his life under house arrest.

But the truth does not recant.

It took the Church more than a century to accept what Galileo had proven. Quietly, reluctantly, without grand announcements, the theological establishment eventually made adjustments. The model changed. The cosmology shifted. Christianity moved on.

This is the pattern we must understand: Science will not backtrack to affirm the Church's status quo. When observation and evidence demonstrate that the world works in certain ways, no amount of theological insistence will change the facts. The Church can resist for a generation or a century, but eventually reality wins.

The only question is how much credibility Christianity will lose in the resistance.

## John Knox and the Birth of Democracy

Before we move further into the scientific revolution, we must note another revolutionary development happening simultaneously.

In Scotland, a reformer named John Knox was building something new. His innovation was not primarily theological, though he had strong theological convictions. It was structural.

Knox founded the Presbyterian Church, named for its system of governance: the presbytery. Instead of hierarchical authority flowing down from pope to bishop to priest, Presbyterianism vested authority in a body of elected representatives. Elders from local congregations gathered to make decisions together.

This was a revolution in governance.

Consider what it meant. The Roman Catholic system assumed that truth and authority flowed from the top down. The Pope, as Christ's vicar on earth, possessed supreme authority. Bishops derived authority from the Pope. Priests derived authority from bishops. The laity received instruction from above.

The Presbyterian model turned this upside down. Authority flowed from the congregation. Representatives were elected. Decisions were made collectively.

The political implications were enormous. If church governance could work this way, why not civil governance? If spiritual authority could derive from the consent of the governed, why not political authority?

John Knox is studied in political history as much as in church history, and rightly so. His ideas about representative governance influenced the development of democratic theory. The American system of government, with its elected representatives and checks on power, owes something to Knox's Presbyterian polity.

This is how ideas spread: from theology to ecclesiology to political philosophy. The Reformation was not just about faith. It was about how human beings organize themselves. And its effects are still reverberating.

## Blaise Pascal: A Bridge Between Worlds

Not all the advances of this era came from Protestant sources. Catholic thinkers, with access to some of the best educational systems in the world, were also making revolutionary contributions.

Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and Catholic theologian. He made foundational contributions to mathematics, including probability theory. He invented early calculating machines. He conducted experiments on atmospheric pressure. He laid groundwork that would lead to Newtonian physics.

And he was a person of deep, passionate Christian faith.

Pascal represents a possibility that the conflict between faith and science often obscures: it is possible to be both. It is possible to pursue scientific truth rigorously while maintaining devout religious commitment. The adversarial relationship between faith and science is not inevitable. It is a choice, made by people on both sides who insist that one must be the enemy of the other.

Pascal chose differently. He saw mathematical and scientific investigation as ways of knowing God's creation. He saw faith and reason as complementary, not competing. He wrote both the Provincial Letters, defending Jansenist theology against Jesuit critics, and the Pensees, a profound meditation on faith and doubt that remains influential today.

The Protestant Reformation challenged Catholicism theologically and structurally. But that challenge also spurred Catholic intellectual advancement. Some of the best Catholic scholarship, driven by the need to respond to Protestant critiques, emerged during this period.

The two movements were pulling each other forward, even as they pulled apart.

## A Critical Turning Point

Something important shifted during this period, something we have not fully reckoned with.

Before Scholasticism, before the Crusades, the Church had been the driver of cultural progress in Europe. Even when it made terrible choices, even when it pursued empire rather than shalom, it was out in front, shaping the direction of civilization.

But somewhere around this time, a reversal occurred. Scholasticism, with its emphasis on systematic reason, somehow shifted into the driver's seat. And ever since then, the Church has been trailing behind, trying to catch up.

Think about what this means. For the first millennium of Christianity, the Church was the institution advancing learning, preserving texts, educating leaders, driving philosophical development. The great thinkers were churchmen. The great universities were founded by the Church. The direction of culture flowed from the Church outward.

After this period, that relationship reversed. Secular institutions began to advance knowledge faster than the Church could assimilate it. Scientific discoveries outpaced theological adaptation. Cultural movements arose outside the Church and forced the Church to respond.

The Church went from leading to following. From driving to being dragged. From setting the agenda to constantly reacting.

We are still living in that reversal. The Church is still trailing behind, still at war with cultural movements it cannot control, still fighting rearguard actions against scientific developments it did not anticipate.

Whether this was inevitable, whether it could have been otherwise, is a question for debate. What is undeniable is that it happened, and we have never recovered from it.

## Genesis One Revisited

At the very beginning of our journey through Scripture, in the first session of this study, we spent considerable time on Genesis 1. We examined its literary structure, its chiasms, its ancient Near Eastern context. We argued that Genesis is not a scientific lab report but a theological text making theological claims.

That work becomes crucial here.

The conflict between Galileo and the Church arose because people read Scripture as making scientific claims about the structure of the universe. They read passages like "He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved" (Psalm 104:5, NIV) as statements of cosmology rather than poetry. They believed the Bible taught geocentrism. They believed that accepting heliocentrism meant rejecting biblical authority.

But what if they were wrong about what the Bible was teaching? What if the authors of Scripture, like all ancient authors, assumed the cosmology of their time without that assumption being the point of the text? What if Genesis tells us that God created, and the creation is good, and humans are made in God's image, without specifying the precise mechanisms by which creation occurred?

This is not abandoning biblical authority. It is reading the Bible the way it was meant to be read: as theology, as literature, as proclamation of truth about God and humanity and the purpose of existence. It is refusing to make the Bible answer questions it was not written to answer.

The medieval Church made the Bible answer cosmological questions. When science provided different answers, the Bible appeared to lose. But the Bible never claimed to be teaching cosmology in the first place. The loss was in the misreading.

We should take this lesson to heart. When we make the Bible compete with science in science's own domain, we are setting Scripture up for a defeat it does not deserve. We are asking it to be something it never claimed to be.

## The Awkward Growth Phase

The Church moved awkwardly through the Age of Enlightenment. This growth curve would not end soon.

We are still in the awkward growth phase of this era. We continue to have a hard time appreciating the world of faith and science. We often see those two worlds as enemies. We have never truly recovered from the adversarial tone struck during this period.

This should trouble us. Five centuries after Copernicus, we are still fighting versions of the same battle. The specific scientific claims have changed, but the dynamic has not. Science advances, challenges existing interpretations, and the Church divides between those who reject the science and those who adjust the interpretation.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world watches Christians fight each other over questions that science settled long ago. And they draw conclusions about the relevance and credibility of Christian faith.

Is this really what following Jesus requires? Must we insist on interpretations of Scripture that contradict observable reality? Must we continue the pattern that made the Church look foolish when it opposed Galileo?

Or can we learn from history? Can we be humble enough to acknowledge that our interpretations might be wrong without that meaning that Scripture is wrong? Can we give science its domain and theology its domain without forcing them into unnecessary conflict?

The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries forced Christianity to grow up. The Church resisted that growth, clinging to the familiar cosmology as if faith itself depended on it. But faith did not depend on geocentrism. And eventually, the Church adapted and survived.

We face similar choices in our own time. May we have the wisdom to learn from those who came before.

## The Road Ahead

The collision of faith and science in this period was painful, but it was also clarifying. It forced Christianity to articulate what was essential and what was merely assumed. It demonstrated that the Church could survive having its cosmology overturned. It proved that faith could adapt to new understandings of the physical world without losing its core.

These are important lessons as we face our own challenges.

The next chapter will trace what happened as Protestant freedom expanded, as the Enlightenment matured, and as the Western world began its decisive turn away from Christendom. The seeds planted in this period, both the seeds of reform and the seeds of secularization, would grow into a forest that would reshape everything.

But before we move on, let us sit with the image of Galileo, under house arrest, forbidden to teach what he knew to be true. The Church that silenced him thought it was defending the faith. In fact, it was defending an interpretation that had been grafted onto the faith, an interpretation that was never essential.

May we have the discernment to know the difference in our own time.

May we have the courage to let go of what was never essential so that we can hold fast to what is.

And may we never again make the Bible compete in a contest it was not designed to enter.
