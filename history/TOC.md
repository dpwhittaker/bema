# How We Lost the Plot: A Journey Through 2,000 Years of Church History

## Table of Contents

---

## Introduction

This book traces the arc of Christian history from the end of Revelation to the present day, answering the central question: **"If Christ was right at the doorstep, what happened that led us to where we are today?"**

The narrative follows a pattern of loss and recovery: how the early church lost its Jewish roots, its connection to the Text, its subversive community, its model of discipleship, and its culture of wrestling—and what hope exists for recovering these essential elements today.

**Core Thesis**: The separation from Judaism in AD 114-120 was not a minor historical footnote but a catastrophic derailment of redemptive history that we have never recovered from. Yet there is hope: every generation is "perfectly placed" for the future God has in store.

## Part One: Setting the Stage

### [Chapter 1: The Story We Tell](chapter%2001.md)
**How we approach history matters as much as the history itself**

This opening chapter establishes the framework for understanding church history, provides a comprehensive review of the biblical narrative from Genesis to Revelation, and introduces the concept of three-part eschatology—the idea that Christ's return is not fixed but stands in relation to our obedience. All history-telling is prophetic storytelling, and the early church's radical obedience was actually working.

**Key Themes:** Partnership to Revelation, Empire vs. Kingdom, Message/Mode/Milieu, Three-part eschatology, Tikkun Olam

## Part Two: The Great Schism and Its Aftermath (AD 100-500)

### [Chapter 2: The Schism That Never Healed](chapter%2002.md)
**How the Jewish-Gentile split fundamentally altered Christianity's trajectory**

The catastrophic event that derailed redemptive history: during the Trajan/Hadrian persecutions (AD 114-120), Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish brothers and sisters to save themselves. This chapter traces the devastating consequences: loss of connection to the Text, Gnostic influence filling the vacuum, anti-Semitism emerging within generations, and a Marcionite approach to Scripture that persists today.

**Key Themes:** The Trajan/Hadrian persecutions, The betrayal, Gnosticism, Marcion's heresy, Anti-Semitism's roots

### [Chapter 3: When Empire Claimed the Church](chapter%2003.md)
**The Constantinian shift and the transformation of Christianity into Christendom**

Constantine's vision at Milvian Bridge transformed a persecuted minority movement into Imperial Christianity. The councils addressed important theological questions about Christ's nature, but this chapter argues the shift represents a fundamental loss—from orthopraxy (right practice) to orthodoxy (right belief), from tikkun olam and blessing nations to philosophical debates about hypostatic unions.

**Key Themes:** Constantine's vision, Convenience converts, The four major councils, Orthodoxy vs. Orthopraxy, The fall of Rome

## Part Three: The Medieval Church (AD 500-1300)

### [Chapter 4: East and West: Two Ways of Knowing](chapter%2004.md)
**The growing divide between Eastern and Western Christianity**

The Iconoclastic Controversy reveals how different cultures preserve divine truth—the West through words and doctrine, the East through images and icons. Both were trying to maintain theological truth in a world without printing presses. These differences, combined with Charlemagne's unification of the West and growing tensions over papal authority, led to the Great East-West Schism of 1054.

**Key Themes:** Iconoclastic Controversy, Charlemagne, The "Dark Ages" that weren't, The Great Schism, Christendom defined

### [Chapter 5: A Dark Chapter We Must Own](chapter%2005.md)
**The Crusades and the problem of Christian historical memory**

One of Christianity's darkest periods demands honest reckoning. Rather than defending or excusing this history, Christians must own their entire past. Using the contrast between Jewish historical memory ("WE were in Egypt") and Christian selective memory, this chapter calls for accountability. A dark history disowned will be repeated.

**Key Themes:** The Crusades as Empire not Shalom, Historical memory, Thomas Aquinas, Scholasticism, 1000 years removed from Jesus's Jewish movement

## Part Four: Reformation and Enlightenment (AD 1300-1800)

### [Chapter 6: Seeds of Reform](chapter%2006.md)
**Corruption, indulgences, and the voices crying for change**

The post-Crusades church, broken and desperate for money, developed the corrupt system of indulgences—selling forgiveness for a price. Yet even in the darkest corruption, "there's always a remnant." Pre-Reformation heroes like John Wycliffe and John Hus fought for Scripture in common languages and resistance to papal authority, preparing the way for the Reformation.

**Key Themes:** The age of indulgences, Wycliffe and Bible translation, John Hus, Medieval nationalism, Luther/Zwingli/Calvin, Priesthood of all believers

### [Chapter 7: Faith Meets Science](chapter%2007.md)
**The collision of Christianity and the Age of Enlightenment**

Without the Reformation, Christianity wouldn't have survived the next 200 years. The collision of faith and science, particularly the Copernican revolution and Galileo's proof of heliocentrism, forced the church to grow painfully. The chapter draws explicit parallels to contemporary science-faith conflicts: "Spoiler alert: Copernicus was right."

**Key Themes:** John Knox and democracy, Copernican revolution, Galileo proves heliocentrism, Blaise Pascal, The church stops leading culture

### [Chapter 8: Freedom and Fragmentation](chapter%2008.md)
**Protestant diversity, scientific revolution, and the birth of the post-Christian era**

150 years from the Reformation through the Age of Enlightenment. Newton, Locke, Wesley, and Voltaire each shaped the emerging modern world. The Edict of Nantes brought Protestant freedom—with both positive effects (freedom to think, study, teach) and negative (loss of unifying structure, mass splintering). The French Revolution marked the birth of the post-Christian era.

**Key Themes:** Newton and modernity, Locke's liberalism, Edict of Nantes, John Wesley, Voltaire's critique, French Revolution, Birth of post-Christian era

## Part Five: The American Experiment and Modern Era (AD 1800-Today)

### [Chapter 9: Awakening, Splintering, and American Religion](chapter%2009.md)
**How American freedom shaped new religious movements**

Protestant Christianity handled newfound freedom in America. The Second Great Awakening and camp meetings led to spiritual revival and Pentecostalism. The Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement drew people together before fragmenting. American freedom also produced movements departing from orthodoxy. The Scofield Bible popularized dispensationalism. The Social Gospel recovered biblical concern for the poor. The Scopes Trial lit the powder keg of fundamentalism.

**Key Themes:** Second Great Awakening, Stone-Campbell Movement, Scofield Bible and dispensationalism, Social Gospel, Scopes Trial and fundamentalism

### [Chapter 10: From Fundamentalism to the Future](chapter%2010.md)
**The last century of church history and where we find ourselves today**

Fundamentalism and theological liberalism became the only two options—"equally bad options." World War II shattered humanistic optimism and gave Christianity a turnaround, leading to modern evangelicalism. Meanwhile, Jacob Neusner's work brought Jewish and Christian scholars together for the first time in 1800 years, and N.T. Wright's Kingdom theology emerged from that collaboration. BEMA itself is "the result of that collision."

**Key Themes:** Fundamentalism vs. liberalism, World War II, Billy Graham era, Jacob Neusner's revolution, N.T. Wright and Kingdom theology, Emerging Church, Culture wars

## Part Six: Recovery and Hope

### [Chapter 11: You Are Here - The Four Pillars](chapter%2011.md)
**What we lost and what we can recover**

The "Four Pillars of BEMA"—essential elements from first-century Judaism that we lost and must recover:
1. **TEXT** - Having the Bible IN you, not just on your shelf
2. **COMMUNITY** - Radical, subversively inclusive fellowship
3. **DISCIPLESHIP** - Total immersion into a way of living
4. **WRESTLING** - Questions as doorways to discovery

The chapter then turns to hope: unprecedented access to Bible study tools, tools for community, the Jesus-model of discipleship still works, and postmodern complexity creates incredible opportunity for wrestling.

**Key Themes:** The Four Pillars, Hope for each pillar, "Time in Babylon," The journey of 1000 miles

### [Chapter 12: Commissioned and Sent](chapter%2012.md)
**Benediction, commissioning, and the journey ahead**

The final chapter is a blessing and commissioning for the journey ahead. It acknowledges the wilderness of sorting through faith, the mess of half-unpacked boxes, the trail of baggage left behind. But it also declares: "Stop waiting for someone else to validate your created self. That is done." You are commissioned for the work of the gospel. The book ends not with conclusion but with beginning.

**Key Themes:** The wilderness journey, Streams in the desert, Stop waiting for validation, Your ministry begins now, We are kingdom people, Peace be with you
