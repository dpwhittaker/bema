# Chapter 9: Awakening, Splintering, and American Religion

Something strange happened when Christianity crossed the Atlantic and planted itself in American soil. The seeds of European faith, carried in the hearts of German Lutherans, Scottish Presbyterians, and Dutch Reformed colonists, found themselves in radically new ground. The old structures that had held Christianity together for centuries---creeds, confessions, hierarchies, state sponsorship---these all seemed foreign in a land built on revolution and independence. The result was both beautiful and bewildering: a century of religious awakening, innovation, and fragmentation unlike anything the church had ever seen.

## Camp Meetings and the Second Great Awakening

As the nineteenth century dawned, American Christianity faced a crisis. The French Revolution had ushered in the post-Christian era. Voltaire's critiques had landed. The Enlightenment had reshaped how people thought about knowledge, authority, and truth. In Europe, the old Christendom was crumbling. But in America, something unexpected happened: revival.

The Second Great Awakening---building on the Methodist fire kindled by John Wesley a generation earlier---swept through North America like a wildfire. And its most distinctive expression was the camp meeting.

Picture the scene: 1801, somewhere in the Kentucky wilderness. Families from different churches, different backgrounds, different states converge on a clearing. For days, they camp together---eating, sleeping, worshiping under the open sky. Preachers take turns at the makeshift pulpit. Hymns rise into the night air. People confess their sins, weep over their failures, and commit their lives anew to following Jesus. Denominations blur. Presbyterian and Baptist and Methodist share bread and song. Something is happening that feels like Acts chapter 2---the Spirit poured out, the people united, the gospel alive. As Peter proclaimed on that first Pentecost, quoting the prophet Joel: "I will pour out my Spirit on all people" (Acts 2:17, NIV).

These camp meetings became crucibles of revival. After centuries of Scholastic theology, political debates about church governance, and the cold rationalism of the Enlightenment, American Christians were asking a desperate question: Where is the art? Where is the beauty? Where is the Holy Spirit?

The camp meetings answered. They became spaces where intellectual Christianity gave way to experiential faith. True confession. True repentance. The Holy Spirit moving in ways that couldn't be systematized or controlled. Many historians trace the rise of Pentecostalism to this fertile soil---a movement that would insist the gifts of the Spirit weren't relegated to the apostolic age but were alive and available in every generation.

The Second Great Awakening reminds us of something vital: the Christian faith was never meant to be merely intellectual. There is a place for doctrine, for careful thought, for theological precision. But Christianity has always been more than propositions to affirm. It is a living relationship with the living God. When the church forgets this---when it becomes all head and no heart---awakening movements emerge to remind us what we've lost.

## The Clash of Old and New

Yet even as revival fires burned, a fundamental tension was building in American Christianity. The immigrants who settled this new land brought their European church cultures with them. If you migrated from Germany, you came with other Germans. That community was probably Lutheran. When you established your colony, it was German Lutheran. The same pattern held for Scottish Presbyterians, Dutch Reformed, English Anglicans.

This created what we might call "colonial denominationalism"---religious identity tied to geography, nationality, and cultural heritage. Churches demanded that members affirm particular creeds and confessions before participating fully in the community. The Westminster Confession, for instance, functioned as a gate: You will affirm this document in order to belong to this tribe.

The problem was that these immigrants were simultaneously building something entirely new: a nation founded on freedom, independence, and the rejection of imposed authority. The old European church structures---with their creeds, their hierarchies, their entanglement with state power---suddenly felt foreign to the American experiment. It was like trying to transplant a tree that couldn't survive in this climate.

This clash between inherited European Christianity and emerging American ideals would produce one of the most innovative---and chaotic---periods in church history.

## The Beauty of Unity: The Stone-Campbell Movement

In the midst of all this splintering, one movement emerged that seemed to push against the current. While everyone else was dividing, this group was drawing people together.

Barton Stone was a recently ordained Presbyterian minister when he was asked to sign the Westminster Confession before receiving communion. The request appalled him. He thought: No. We shouldn't have to sign a doctrinal document before we can receive bread and cup. Shouldn't faith in Jesus be enough?

Stone wasn't alone. Others across different denominations were having the same experience---watching creeds and confessions become tools of exclusion rather than markers of shared faith. They wanted to restore something simpler, something they associated with the early church described in Acts: Christians united around Jesus, not around theological fine print.

Meanwhile, Thomas Campbell in America and his son Alexander in Europe were undergoing remarkably similar journeys. They discovered each other and found their convictions aligned. Eventually, the Stone and Campbell movements merged, creating what became known as the Restoration Movement---encompassing churches that would come to be called Christian Church, Churches of Christ, and Disciples of Christ.

The irony is poignant: At the very moment American Christianity was splintering into a thousand fragments, this movement was drawing people together across denominational lines. For a season, at least, it represented the ideal of Christian unity---believers gathering around Jesus and Scripture rather than human creeds.

Of course, the movement didn't stay unified. Within a few decades, it too had fragmented. The very impulse that brought people together---the rejection of human authority structures---also made it difficult to maintain cohesion when disagreements arose. There was no pope, no council, no confession to appeal to. Just Scripture and conscience. And sincere Christians read Scripture differently.

Still, the Restoration Movement's founding vision remains compelling: that Christians might unite around Jesus rather than human inventions. That creeds and confessions, however useful, should never become the gate to the Kingdom. That perhaps we made things too complicated somewhere along the way, and the answer lies in restoration rather than further innovation.

## Freedom's Double Edge

The American experiment in religious freedom proved to be a double-edged sword. On one side, it produced genuine renewal---people freely exploring their faith, asking new questions, discovering new dimensions of life with God. On the other side, it produced movements that wandered far from the Christian mainstream.

In this era of spiritual entrepreneurship, Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Charles Russell established what would become the Jehovah's Witnesses. Ellen G. White helped launch the Seventh-Day Adventist movement. Each of these emerged from the same cultural moment: disgust with the direction of established Christianity, combined with the American conviction that anyone could start something new.

How do we evaluate these movements? It's tempting to lump them together, to create categories of "cults" and "genuine Christianity" and sort accordingly. But real people were involved---sincere seekers looking for truth, families trying to live faithfully, communities attempting to follow God as they understood him. Theological precision matters, and there are significant distinctions between these movements and orthodox Christianity. But generosity and hospitality matter too.

What's undeniable is that all these movements capitalized on the same American ethos: freedom, independence, the rejection of old authorities, the conviction that something new could emerge on this soil.

## The Scofield Bible and the Shape of Eschatology

Among the era's most influential developments was a book that appeared in 1909: the Scofield Reference Bible.

This was one of the first study Bibles---a complete Scripture text with explanatory notes printed in the margins. It was mass-produced, mass-marketed, and mass-distributed in ways that had never been possible before the printing press revolution. For millions of American Christians, the Scofield Bible became their primary way of engaging Scripture. Its notes carried almost the same authority as the biblical text itself.

The problem was its theology.

C.I. Scofield promoted a system called dispensationalism---the idea that God relates to humanity through distinct periods or "dispensations" with different rules and expectations. More significantly, Scofield popularized a particular eschatological framework: the rapture, the tribulation, the millennial kingdom---concepts that would later find their fullest expression in Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins's "Left Behind" series.

There's no polite way to say this: the Scofield Bible's theological notes propagated ideas that had never been the Christian mainstream. They were presented as though they represented obvious biblical teaching, but they were actually innovative interpretations that previous centuries of Christians would not have recognized. This eschatological worldview became the default for American evangelicalism, but it was not the historic Christian understanding.

We are still deconstructing these ideas today. The two-part eschatology that Scofield popularized---where Christ's return is fixed and predetermined, where we're essentially waiting for the end with no agency in the matter---contradicts the biblical picture of three-part eschatology, where our obedience participates in God's restoration of the world. The Scofield framework encouraged passivity: Jesus is coming soon, so why polish brass on a sinking ship? Biblical eschatology, by contrast, commissioned active participation in tikkun olam---the healing of the world.

One study Bible, distributed to millions, shaped how generations of American Christians understood the end times, the nature of Israel, the relationship between Old and New Testaments, and their own responsibility in the world. It's a sobering reminder of how much influence a single publication can wield.

## The Social Gospel: Recovering Biblical Justice

While some Christians were focused on eschatological speculation, others were rediscovering the Bible's persistent concern for the poor.

William Booth was a Methodist minister who founded the Salvation Army in 1865. He became a leading figure in what came to be called the Social Gospel movement---an effort to recapture the biblical emphasis on caring for the marginalized, the oppressed, the forgotten.

In conservative evangelical circles today, "Social Gospel" often carries negative connotations. It's associated with theological liberalism, with prioritizing politics over personal salvation, with losing the gospel's spiritual core. This is unfortunate, because the movement was simply trying to recapture a practical emphasis on caring for the poor that had been displaced by more abstract theological concerns.

The margins. The mumzer---the outcast, the one of questionable birth. The alien, the orphan, and the widow. These categories appear throughout Scripture, from the Torah's commands to leave grain in the corners of fields for the poor---"When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field... Leave them for the poor and for the foreigner residing among you" (Leviticus 23:22, NIV)---to the prophets' thundering denunciations of those who exploited the vulnerable, to Jesus's teaching: "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me" (Matthew 25:40, NIV).

There is very much a social component to the Gospel from Genesis to Revelation. This isn't a liberal add-on to the message of salvation. It's woven into the fabric of biblical faith from the beginning. The Social Gospel movement, whatever its theological weaknesses, was attempting to recover something genuine that had been lost.

In an increasingly industrialized world where the gap between rich and poor was widening rapidly, the question of how Christians should respond to systemic poverty and injustice couldn't be avoided. Some answered with theological speculation about the end times. Others answered by rolling up their sleeves and serving the poor. The Salvation Army chose the latter---and a century and a half later, it remains one of the most recognized charitable organizations in the world.

## The Scopes Trial and the Birth of Fundamentalism

After the devastation of World War I, Christendom in North America turned its attention from fighting foreign enemies to fighting ideological ones. And in 1925, in Dayton, Tennessee, the powder keg exploded.

The Scopes Trial---the famous "Monkey Trial"---pitted Christian fundamentalists against modernist ideas about evolution and the age of the earth. It became a spectacle, a media circus, a defining moment in the emerging culture war between traditional Christianity and secular culture. William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution, Clarence Darrow for the defense, the world watching as faith and science collided in a courtroom.

In the immediate aftermath, Christians divided into two camps: those who embraced fundamentalism's fierce opposition to modernism, and those who sought accommodation with the new scientific understanding. The middle ground vanished. Nuance became impossible.

But here's what makes this history so uncomfortable: we've been here before.

Remember Copernicus and Galileo? Remember how the church insisted that geocentrism was not just science but theology---that the earth at the center of the universe was a biblical truth? Remember how the church took nearly a century to accept what turned out to be correct?

The Scopes Trial rings "incredibly reminiscent" of that earlier conflict. In both cases, the church identified a particular scientific understanding as essential to faith. In both cases, new evidence challenged that understanding. In both cases, the church chose to fight rather than investigate. And in both cases, the church found itself on the wrong side of truth.

Spoiler alert: Copernicus was right. The earth really does revolve around the sun.

The honest question is whether we're making the same mistake again. Are we misidentifying our enemy? Are we fighting for the wrong things? Are we so committed to defending particular conclusions that we've lost the ability to learn? A dark history disowned will be repeated. If we don't wrestle honestly with this pattern, the next few centuries may not look back on our day with kindness.

## The Complexity of Splintering

One of the most difficult aspects of American religious fragmentation is what it does to learning. When Christianity was more unified---even imperfectly so---a theologian in France could influence the whole church. A council's decision carried weight across Christendom. Insights could spread; mistakes could be corrected through shared conversation.

But with a thousand different movements, each suspicious of the others, each convinced of its own correctness, how can anyone have influence? Every group has to make its own mistakes independently. Every tradition has to learn its own lessons. There's less shared wisdom, less collective memory, less ability to hear from Christians who think differently.

This is perhaps the deepest cost of splintering. It's not just that we disagree---it's that we've lost the ability to learn from each other's disagreements. We circle our wagons, defend our tribe, and miss the insights that might come from genuine engagement with those who see things differently.

The nineteenth century gave American Christianity extraordinary freedom. It produced revivals and renewal, innovative movements and genuine spiritual awakening. But it also produced fragmentation, isolation, and the loss of shared conversation. Freedom is a gift. But like all gifts, it can be misused.

## Where This Leaves Us

The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries bequeathed to American Christianity a complicated inheritance. On the positive side: camp meeting revival, restoration ideals of unity, the Social Gospel's recovery of biblical justice, the democratization of faith that put spiritual responsibility in the hands of ordinary believers rather than ordained elites.

On the negative side: theological innovations like dispensationalism that distorted eschatology for generations, the culture war mentality that emerged from the fundamentalist-modernist controversy, the endless splintering that made learning from each other nearly impossible, and the persistent temptation to misidentify our enemies.

War always seems to hinder progress. After World War I, instead of continuing the growth of the previous century, American Christianity turned inward, became defensive, focused on culture wars rather than kingdom expansion. This pattern would intensify in the decades ahead.

The question for us is whether we can receive this inheritance critically---appreciating what was good, learning from what went wrong, and charting a better path forward. Can we have camp meeting passion without theological shallowness? Can we pursue restoration unity without losing doctrinal substance? Can we care for the poor without losing the gospel's spiritual core? Can we engage scientific discovery without either capitulating to secularism or repeating the Galileo mistake?

These questions haunted the twentieth century. They haunt us still. But as we'll see in the next chapter, the century ahead would bring both catastrophe and unexpected hope---a collision of worlds that nobody could have predicted, and that changes everything about how we might move forward today.
