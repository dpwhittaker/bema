# Chapter 11: You Are Here

We have traveled a long road together.

From b'reisheit bara Elohim---"in the beginning, God created"---through patriarchs and prophets, exile and return, Jesus and his first followers, we traced the story Scripture tells. Then we watched that story continue: the catastrophic schism that separated Christianity from its Jewish roots, the rise of Christendom, the fragmentation of the Reformation, the collision with science, the American experiment, the twentieth century's horrors and hopes.

Now we stand at "You Are Here"---that red dot on the map of history marking our present location.

The journey has been long. Much has been lost along the way. But if we have eyes to see, much can still be recovered. This chapter is about both: what we lost, and what we might find again.

## The Four Pillars

When we look at the first-century church---rooted in first-century Judaism, walking in the way of Jesus, turning the world upside down---four things stand out. These were the essential elements that made the movement what it was. Call them the Four Pillars. And remarkably, all four are visible throughout Scripture from the very beginning.

These pillars didn't originate with the early church. They were woven into the fabric of Israelite faith from Sinai onward. Jesus didn't invent them---he embodied them. The early Christians didn't innovate---they continued a tradition that stretched back through the prophets and priests and kings of Israel to Abraham himself.

We lost all four.

But we can recover them. And that recovery begins with understanding what they are.

## Pillar One: Text

The first-century Jewish world was deeply committed to Scripture. This commitment went far beyond what most modern Christians can imagine.

Children began memorizing Torah at an early age---not verses, but entire books. By adolescence, many had committed the first five books of the Bible to memory. The most dedicated students went on to memorize the Prophets and Writings as well. The Psalms weren't just texts to study; they were songs so familiar they could be recited from memory during any circumstance of life.

This wasn't an elite practice reserved for rabbis. It was the normal expectation for people of faith. The words of Scripture lived inside them, shaping their thoughts, forming their character, providing language for every situation they faced.

Without the printing press, this oral commitment to memory proved invaluable. The community carried the sacred text within them. It was always accessible, never lost, constantly repeated and reinforced through communal worship and daily practice.

Then came the schism. When we rejected our Jewish identity and separated from our Jewish brothers and sisters, we didn't just lose relationships. We lost something even more precious: we lost the Text.

Not literally, of course. We still have the Bible. We've printed billions of copies. We carry it on our phones. We can access any verse in seconds. In one sense, we have more access to Scripture than any generation in history.

But there's a difference between having a Bible on your shelf and having the Bible in you.

The prophet Isaiah described God's word as rain: "As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth... so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire" (Isaiah 55:10-11, NIV). Paul called the word of God "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Ephesians 6:17, NIV). There's power in these words---not just information, but transformation. When Scripture lives inside us, it shapes us from within.

We exchanged that power for something lesser: a fascination with doctrine and creed. We became people who argued about the Bible rather than people who knew the Bible. We developed sophisticated systems for interpreting texts we had never memorized. We wrote theological tomes about books we had never internalized.

Some push back on this. They say: "We don't need the Bible like that. The Jews got too focused on the Text. We just need the Holy Spirit."

But consider this: the very Bible we call inspired identifies the word of God as the sword of the Spirit. As Jesus said, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you---they are full of the Spirit and life" (John 6:63, NIV). Those two things---Word and Spirit---are intimately connected. When you take the word away, you take away a key connection to the Spirit's work. The first-century church didn't choose between Scripture and Spirit. They had both. They were both.

## Pillar Two: Community

From the beginning, the people of God were called to live differently from the surrounding culture. Abraham was called out of Ur. Israel was called out of Egypt. The community of faith was always meant to be a visible alternative to the empires of the world.

This alternative community was subversive. It rejected the lies that empire promotes: self-preservation at all costs, luxury as the goal of life, comfort as the highest good, leisure as the reward for success. These are the tools of empire. They keep populations compliant. They direct energy toward consumption rather than transformation.

The community of faith was supposed to model something different: generous hospitality, radical simplicity, Sabbath rest that trusted God rather than anxious striving that trusted only self. When the world looked at this community, they were supposed to see a better way to live.

But our Hellenistic ways always deceive us.

When we jettisoned connection to the Jewish world---a community that had been living in intentional subversion to pagan narrative for centuries---we were left with our own pagan roots. Roman worldview. Imperial assumptions. Self-preservation, luxury, comfort, leisure. We absorbed the very things we were supposed to resist.

And we still do.

The most fascinating and effective tool of the Kingdom is inclusive community. Not just friends who share our beliefs. Not just fellowship with people who think like us, vote like us, live like us. Radical fellowship with people we don't agree with. That's what makes the church the church. That's what makes it a Eucharistic community---a gathering around the table where all are welcome because Christ is the host.

This kind of community shows the world a better way. It demonstrates that enemies can become friends. That walls can come down. That people who disagree about important things can still share bread and wine and call each other family. In a world fractured by tribalism, such community is revolutionary.

But we have lost it. We divide ourselves by politics, by preference, by race and class and theological system. We create communities of the like-minded where everyone agrees and no one is challenged. We call this fellowship, but it's something less. It's tribalism baptized in Christian language.

## Pillar Three: Discipleship

Consider what Jesus did.

He started no churches. He went on no missionary journeys. He developed no curriculum. He organized no conferences.

What he did, and what he commanded us to do, was make disciples.

He spent three years with twelve young men---and some women as well---all day, every day. He walked with them, ate with them, taught them, corrected them, modeled for them. He showed them how to pray, how to respond to criticism, how to care for the marginalized, how to face death without fear. Total immersion into a way of living.

And it changed the course of human history.

The first-century model of discipleship was one of the most effective methods of training ever developed. A disciple literally followed the rabbi---walked behind him, watched his every move, absorbed his teaching through constant proximity. The goal wasn't just to learn the rabbi's ideas but to become like the rabbi. "Be covered in the dust of your rabbi" was the famous saying. Walk so closely that his dust settles on you. As Jesus said, "A student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher" (Luke 6:40, NIV).

This kind of discipleship produces transformation at the deepest level. Not just new information but new character. Not just different beliefs but different instincts. The disciple becomes like the master through constant exposure over extended time.

We don't do this anymore. We just don't.

We run programs. We organize Bible studies. We hold conferences. We develop curricula. These things can be valuable. But they are not discipleship in the first-century sense.

Jesus didn't tell his followers to develop educational programs for the masses. He told them: "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20, NIV)---to find a few people and invest in them intensively, totally, the way he had invested in the Twelve. He believed that deep investment in a few would ultimately reach more people than shallow investment in many.

We reversed his method. We chose breadth over depth. We reached millions with our crusades and broadcasts and publications. But did we make disciples? Or did we make converts who were left without the formation they needed to actually follow Jesus?

## Pillar Four: Wrestling

Jacob, the father of the Israelites, was a wrestler. That's what his name means: "he struggles" or "he contends." And that wrestling defined not just him but his descendants. Israel---the name given to Jacob after his nightlong struggle with God---means "one who wrestles with God." As the angel declared, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome" (Genesis 32:28, NIV).

The early church inherited this tradition of wrestling. They didn't believe that having all the answers was the point. They believed the Text was meant to be wrestled with---questioned, probed, turned over and over until it yielded new insight. Life was complicated and messy, full of shades of gray. There were no simple formulas or self-help strategies that could reduce faith to a system.

What they believed in was walking the way. Taking the next faithful step. Living with questions unresolved while trusting that working with God to restore the world would be worth the great wrestling match.

This too was lost.

When we lost the Text, questions and doubts became threatening. If you don't really know Scripture---if it isn't living inside you, shaping your thinking, providing resources for wrestling---then questions feel like attacks. Someone challenges your belief, and you have nothing to draw from except the doctrinal formulation you were taught. That formulation must be defended at all costs because it's all you have.

So we began to identify orthodox answers and discourage dissent. We created systems where questions marked you as dangerous, where doubt signaled weak faith, where wrestling was seen as failure rather than faithful engagement.

This was a tragic reversal. The Jewish world from which Christianity emerged was founded on a culture of chutzpah---holy boldness in engaging with God and text. Abraham argued with God. Moses argued with God. The prophets argued with God. The Psalms are full of complaint and accusation and demand. Wrestling was how Israel loved God.

We created an experiment that didn't look like that. We created communities where questions were threats to be managed rather than doorways to be explored. Where doubt was weakness rather than the growing edge of faith. Where certainty was virtue and uncertainty was vice.

## Where We Are Today

So here we stand.

We still don't know our Text. Not really. Not the way first-century Jews knew theirs. We have Bibles everywhere, but the Bible is not in us.

We find it nearly impossible to experiment with true community. Our idolatry of consumerism and comfort holds us captive. We seek out people who agree with us and avoid those who don't. We sort ourselves into camps---Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative, this denomination, that network---and call our tribal gatherings "church."

We run programs and invest in programmatic ministries rather than believing that discipleship could change the world. We've systematized and scaled and optimized, and in the process we've lost the inefficient, time-intensive, life-on-life investment that Jesus modeled.

We still discourage people from asking questions that push boundaries or color outside lines. Questions threaten our systems. Doubts threaten our certainty. Wrestling threatens our control.

This assessment stings. But honesty is the beginning of healing.

## But Is There Any Hope?

Yes.

Despite all this criticism, despite this unflinching look at what we've lost, there is genuine hope. God has placed us here for such a time as this. And every single thing we lost can be recovered.

### Hope for the Text

We live in an unprecedented moment for biblical access. The internet puts more Bible study tools at our fingertips than any generation in history has possessed. Online lexicons allow word studies that once required access to a seminary library. Parallel translations, historical commentaries, archaeological discoveries---all available for free, instantly, to anyone with an internet connection.

If first-century disciples knew we had biblegateway.com, that we could search the Hebrew or Greek in seconds, that we could access the full text of Josephus or the Mishnah with a few keystrokes---they would roll over in their graves. What they would have given for such resources!

We have the tools. The question is whether we'll use them.

We may never match the memorization levels of Orthodox Judaism. But we can pursue understanding. We can keep learning, learning, learning. We can create our own kind of Essene community---people who seek to know the path and walk the path, who commit to getting the Scripture inside us rather than just having it available.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. Start with one paragraph a week. Memorize one Psalm. Read one book of the Bible slowly, repeatedly, until it becomes part of you. Then add more. Drops of rain form mighty rivers. A little here, a little there, until understanding comes like a rushing spring.

### Hope for Community

If we are human, we are capable of great community. This is our nature as God's image-bearers. The capacity for deep connection isn't something we need to manufacture; it's something we need to rediscover.

There is no reason we cannot create subversively inclusive communities that show the lies of our culture's idolatry for what they are. Communities that demonstrate the way of Jesus as the best way to live. Communities that teach the world how to Sabbath, how to forgive, how to practice generosity and hospitality. Communities that look out for the mumzer---the outcast, the marginalized, the one whom everyone else has written off.

We have tools to facilitate community like never before. The COVID-19 pandemic, for all its devastation, revealed something unexpected: we can connect across distances. We can build relationships through screens. We can create community in new ways.

The question is whether we will settle for pseudo-community that lets us keep our idolatries intact. True community requires sacrifice. It demands that we give up the consumer mindset that asks what we can get and embrace the servant mindset that asks what we can give. It insists that we fellowship with people we disagree with, not just people who reinforce our preferences.

This is hard. But it's possible. And it's essential.

### Hope for Discipleship

The method Jesus used is still available. Total immersion into a way of living---this is still the best context for true learning and transformation.

Our culture doesn't make it easy. We don't have the rhythms of life that facilitated first-century discipleship. But the Great Commission still stands. Make disciples. Not converts who walk an aisle. Not members who attend services. Disciples---people whose lives are fundamentally reshaped through intensive, sustained relationship with more mature believers.

We know how to do this in other contexts. We call it mentorship, apprenticeship, on-the-job training. The young doctor shadows the experienced one. The aspiring craftsman works alongside the master. The new employee learns by watching and doing, not just by reading manuals.

We know this works. The problem is that we haven't created spaces in our faith communities for this kind of experience. We've programmed and curricularized and systematized when what we needed was relationship.

It would mean slowing down. Investing deeply in a few rather than shallowly in many. Being willing to let people into our lives, not just our classrooms. Following Jesus's method instead of inventing our own.

### Hope for Wrestling

Maybe one of the best things postmodernity has given us is a culture that values complexity and rejects simplistic answers.

This is often perceived as a threat. "Moral relativism!" we cry. "Truth is truth, and we must defend it!"

But look more carefully. Much of what gets labeled relativism is actually humility about human knowing. It's the recognition that we see through a glass darkly. That our perspectives are limited. That people who disagree with us might have something to teach us.

This is not the enemy. This is an incredible opportunity.

Younger generations---Millennials, Gen Z---are allergic to simplistic answers. They know life is complicated. They're not looking for pat formulas or three-step solutions. They want space to explore, to question, to wrestle.

We can give them that space. We can recapture a world where questions are not threats to our systems of control but doorways to discovery. We can trust the process of searching, believing that if we truly seek God, we will find him just as he promised: "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart" (Jeremiah 29:13, NIV).

Wrestling isn't the opposite of faith. It's the expression of faith. Jacob didn't wrestle with the angel because he doubted God but because he was desperate to know God. His wrestling was his worship.

## Time in Babylon

Before we close this chapter, we must examine ourselves. It's not enough to diagnose the church's problems from a distance. We must ask where Empire still holds us captive. Where Babylon still shapes our imagination. Where we are exiled without even knowing it.

There's a song by Emmylou Harris called "Time in Babylon." Its lyrics paint a picture of American captivity:

*Five-lane highway danger zone. SUV and a speakerphone. You need that chrome to get you home, doing time in Babylon.*

*Cluster mansion on a hill. Another day in Pleasantville. If you don't like it, take a pill, doing time in Babylon.*

*So put that conscience on the shelf. Keep the best stuff for yourself. Let the rest fight over what is left, doing time in Babylon.*

These lyrics sting because they're accurate. Consumerism. Comfort. Self-medication. Self-preservation. These are the chains of our captivity. And often we don't even recognize them as chains because everyone around us wears them too.

The song ends with a prayer:

*You let your song of healing spark a way out of this dark. Lead us to a higher and a holy ground.*

That's our prayer too. That the prophetic word would convict us. That we would recognize our captivity. That we would find a way out of the darkness to higher and holier ground.

## Beginning the Journey

You won't wake up tomorrow and master all four pillars. That's not how transformation works.

But you can wake up tomorrow with realistic, attainable goals. One small step in each area. One verse memorized. One honest conversation with someone who sees things differently. One relationship invested in more intentionally. One question pursued without demanding an immediate answer.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

The Talmud offers this wisdom: "Just as rain falls in drops and forms mighty rivers, so it is with Torah. A man studies a little here and a little there, until understanding comes like a rushing spring."

A little here. A little there. Drops becoming rivers. Small steps becoming transformation.

This is how it works. This is how it has always worked. The question isn't whether the method is effective. The question is whether we'll begin.

You are here. This is your moment. These are your four pillars. What will you do with them?
