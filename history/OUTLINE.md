# BEMA Season 5: Church History Book Outline

## Working Title: "How We Lost the Plot: A Journey Through 2,000 Years of Church History"

---

## Overview

This book traces the arc of Christian history from the end of Revelation to the present day, answering the central question: **"If Christ was right at the doorstep, what happened that led us to where we are today?"**

The narrative follows a pattern of loss and recovery: how the early church lost its Jewish roots, its connection to the Text, its subversive community, its model of discipleship, and its culture of wrestling - and what hope exists for recovering these essential elements today.

**Core Thesis**: The separation from Judaism in AD 114-120 was not a minor historical footnote but a catastrophic derailment of redemptive history that we have never recovered from. Yet there is hope: every generation is "perfectly placed" for the future God has in store.

## Part One: Setting the Stage

### Chapter 1: The Story We Tell
**Theme**: How we approach history matters as much as the history itself

**Content Sources**: Episodes 191-192

**Chapter Summary**:
This opening chapter establishes the framework for understanding church history. It provides a comprehensive review of the biblical narrative from Genesis to Revelation (the "short review"), establishes that all historians tell stories with bias (including biblical historians), and introduces the concept of three-part eschatology - the idea that Christ's return is not fixed but stands in relation to our obedience.

**Key Concepts**:
- The arc of Scripture: Partnership (Torah) to Revelation (text to context)
- Empire vs. Kingdom of God - the recurring tension
- Message, Mode, and Milieu - a framework for holistic discipleship
- Three-part eschatology vs. two-part eschatology
- Tikkun Olam: Our obedience "speeds the coming" of Christ's return
- All history-telling is prophetic storytelling

**Narrative Purpose**: Prepare readers to think critically about history while understanding that the early church's radical obedience was actually working - the Empire was crumbling, Jesus's feet were at the door. "Then something happened."

## Part Two: The Great Schism and Its Aftermath (AD 100-500)

### Chapter 2: The Schism That Never Healed
**Theme**: How the Jewish-Gentile split fundamentally altered Christianity's trajectory

**Content Sources**: Episode 193

**Chapter Summary**:
This pivotal chapter examines how and why the Jesus movement separated from its Jewish roots. Rejecting the theory that the schism happened during Paul-James tensions, it argues that the critical break occurred during the Trajan/Hadrian persecutions (AD 114-120) when Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish brothers and sisters to save themselves. This chapter traces the devastating consequences: loss of connection to the Text, Gnostic influence filling the vacuum, anti-Semitism emerging within one or two generations, and a Marcionite approach to Scripture that persists today.

**Key Concepts**:
- Two theories of the schism (early vs. later dating)
- The Trajan/Hadrian persecutions and Bar Kochba revolt
- Why Rome targeted Jews (Christians were still seen as Jewish)
- The betrayal: "We're not Jewish and we've got the foreskin to prove it"
- Loss of "walking libraries of Torah"
- Gnosticism and dualism filling the vacuum
- Marcion's heresy and the Muratorian Canon
- The irony: We rejected Marcion but absorbed his methodology

**Narrative Purpose**: Reveal "the something" that happened - the catastrophic event that derailed redemptive history. Ask the haunting question: "If we had stood with our Jewish brothers and sisters, would Jesus have returned?"

### Chapter 3: When Empire Claimed the Church
**Theme**: The Constantinian shift and the transformation of Christianity into Christendom

**Content Sources**: Episode 194

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter examines how Constantine's vision at Milvian Bridge and subsequent legalization of Christianity transformed a persecuted minority movement into Imperial Christianity. While the councils addressed important theological questions about Christ's nature, this chapter argues that the shift represents a fundamental loss - from orthopraxy (right practice) to orthodoxy (right belief), from tikkun olam and blessing nations to philosophical debates about hypostatic unions.

**Key Concepts**:
- Constantine's vision and the Chi-Rho symbol
- What Constantine actually did (vs. common misconceptions)
- The flood of "convenience converts"
- Christianity as "a fad among the Roman elite"
- The four major ecumenical councils and their heresies
- The Council of Nicea to Chalcedon progression
- Orthodoxy vs. Orthopraxy: How we lost the plot
- "The beginning of a downhill slide we have never recovered from"
- The fall of Rome and rise of the Byzantine Empire

**Narrative Purpose**: Show how legalization and power corrupted the movement, transforming it from way of life to set of beliefs.

## Part Three: The Medieval Church (AD 500-1300)

### Chapter 4: East and West: Two Ways of Knowing
**Theme**: The growing divide between Eastern and Western Christianity

**Content Sources**: Episodes 195-196

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter explores the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western approaches to truth, beauty, and worship. The Iconoclastic Controversy reveals how different cultures preserve divine truth - the West through words and doctrine, the East through images and icons. Both were trying to maintain theological truth in a world without printing presses. The chapter traces how these differences, combined with Charlemagne's unification of the West and growing tensions over papal authority, led to the Great East-West Schism of 1054.

**Key Concepts**:
- The Iconoclastic Controversy: Pictures vs. prose
- "Doctrinal idolatry" vs. icon veneration
- Charlemagne and the intellectual revitalization of the West
- The "Dark Ages" that weren't actually dark
- Liturgy and the challenge of preserving truth for the illiterate
- The Great Schism: Rome vs. Constantinople
- Christendom defined: Imperial Christianity with all its implications

**Narrative Purpose**: Show how cultural differences and power struggles fractured the visible church, while both traditions struggled to preserve truth without the Jewish foundation.

### Chapter 5: A Dark Chapter We Must Own
**Theme**: The Crusades and the problem of Christian historical memory

**Content Sources**: Episode 197

**Chapter Summary**:
This unflinching chapter confronts one of Christianity's darkest periods: the Crusades. Rather than defending or excusing this history, it argues that Christians must own their entire past - the dark chapters as well as the bright ones. Using the contrast between Jewish historical memory ("WE were in Egypt") and Christian selective memory, the chapter calls for honest reckoning with violence done in Jesus's name. It also examines the rise of Scholasticism and the growing gap between educated elites and common people.

**Key Concepts**:
- "Nothing brings people together like a common enemy"
- The Crusades as "Empire, not Shalom" - "This is Egypt, this is Pharaoh"
- Historical memory: "A dark history disowned will be repeated"
- The Jewish guide's challenge: Jews can't see Jesus in a vacuum
- Thomas Aquinas and the rise of Scholasticism
- The gap between elite education and common faith
- 1000 years removed from the Jewish movement of Jesus

**Narrative Purpose**: Force readers to wrestle with the most uncomfortable parts of Christian history, arguing that only by owning this history can we avoid repeating it.

## Part Four: Reformation and Enlightenment (AD 1300-1800)

### Chapter 6: Seeds of Reform
**Theme**: Corruption, indulgences, and the voices crying for change

**Content Sources**: Episode 198

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter traces the path from the Crusades to the Protestant Reformation. It examines how the post-Crusades church, broken and desperate for money, developed the corrupt system of indulgences - selling forgiveness for a price. Yet even in the darkest corruption, "there's always a remnant." The chapter highlights pre-Reformation heroes like John Wycliffe (who fought for Scripture in common languages) and John Hus (who led resistance to papal authority and died for it). Medieval nationalism, the Papacy of Avignon, and the Western Schism set the stage for the Reformation that was "simply waiting for good leaders."

**Key Concepts**:
- The age of indulgences: When money bought forgiveness
- The corruption of the sacramental system
- John Wycliffe and Bible translation
- John Hus and the Bohemian Revolt
- Medieval nationalism and shifting identities
- Luther, Zwingli, Calvin: National reformations
- The printing press revolution
- "Priesthood of all believers" and democratization of faith

**Narrative Purpose**: Show how corruption and abuse led to necessary reform, while highlighting faithful remnants who prepared the way.

### Chapter 7: Faith Meets Science
**Theme**: The collision of Christianity and the Age of Enlightenment

**Content Sources**: Episode 199

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter argues that without the Reformation, Christianity wouldn't have survived the next 200 years - not primarily for theological reasons, but because of massive cultural transformation. The collision of faith and science, particularly the Copernican revolution and Galileo's proof of heliocentrism, forced the church to grow painfully. The chapter draws explicit parallels to contemporary science-faith conflicts: "Spoiler alert: Copernicus was right." If we don't learn from history, "the next few centuries may not look back on our day with kindness."

**Key Concepts**:
- John Knox and the birth of democracy through Presbyterian polity
- Copernicus and heliocentric revolution
- Geocentrism as theology, not just science
- Galileo proves the truth; the church takes a century to accept
- Blaise Pascal: Bridging Catholic faith and scientific advancement
- The critical turning point: When the church stopped leading culture
- "Ever since Scholasticism, the church has been trailing behind, trying to catch up"

**Narrative Purpose**: Draw lessons from the church's disastrous response to heliocentrism that apply directly to contemporary science-faith conflicts.

### Chapter 8: Freedom and Fragmentation
**Theme**: Protestant diversity, scientific revolution, and the birth of the post-Christian era

**Content Sources**: Episode 200

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter traces 150 years from the Reformation through the Age of Enlightenment. Newton, Locke, Wesley, and Voltaire each shaped the emerging modern world. The Edict of Nantes brought Protestant freedom - with both positive effects (freedom to think, study, teach) and negative (loss of unifying structure, mass splintering). Voltaire's critique of religion mixed with state power was "accurate" and shaped separation of church and state. The French Revolution marked the birth of the post-Christian era - when the world "unplugged and replugged" no longer blinked Christian by default.

**Key Concepts**:
- Newton and the modern era
- Locke as "father of liberalism" (original meaning: liberty and equality)
- The Edict of Nantes: Freedom and fragmentation
- John Wesley and Methodism
- Voltaire's critique and separation of church and state
- The French Revolution and birth of the post-Christian era
- "The church is still in denial about this"
- The westward shift of cultural power

**Narrative Purpose**: Show how freedom brought both flourishing and fragmentation, culminating in the birth of a post-Christian culture that the church still hasn't fully accepted.

## Part Five: The American Experiment and Modern Era (AD 1800-Today)

### Chapter 9: Awakening, Splintering, and American Religion
**Theme**: How American freedom shaped new religious movements

**Content Sources**: Episode 201

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter examines how Protestant Christianity handled newfound freedom in America. The Second Great Awakening and camp meetings led to spiritual revival and the rise of Pentecostalism. The Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement - Marty's own tradition - initially drew people together across denominational lines before it too fragmented. But American freedom also produced movements that departed from orthodoxy (Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses). The Scofield Bible "wrecked Christian theology" by popularizing dispensationalism. The Social Gospel recovered biblical concern for the poor. And the Scopes Trial lit the powder keg of fundamentalism.

**Key Concepts**:
- The Second Great Awakening and camp meetings
- Colonial denominationalism and its clash with American freedom
- The Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement
- The Scofield Bible and dispensationalist eschatology
- William Booth and the Social Gospel
- "There is very much a social component to the Gospel from Genesis to Revelation"
- The Scopes Trial and eruption of fundamentalism
- "We may be in danger of misidentifying our enemy" - echoes of Copernicus/Galileo

**Narrative Purpose**: Show how American freedom produced both beautiful renewal and problematic fragmentation, with fundamentalism repeating the mistakes of the church's response to heliocentrism.

### Chapter 10: From Fundamentalism to the Future
**Theme**: The last century of church history and where we find ourselves today

**Content Sources**: Episode 202

**Chapter Summary**:
This chapter brings the story to the present day. It examines how fundamentalism and theological liberalism became the only two options for a generation - "equally bad options." World War II shattered humanistic optimism and gave Christianity a turnaround, leading to modern evangelicalism and the Billy Graham/Bill Bright era. Meanwhile, Jacob Neusner's work brought Jewish and Christian scholars together for the first time in 1800 years, and N.T. Wright's Kingdom theology emerged from that collaboration. BEMA itself is "the result of that collision" - academic biblical scholarship meeting grassroots love for Jesus and Scripture.

**Key Concepts**:
- Fundamentalism vs. theological liberalism: Two bad options
- World War II and the shattering of humanistic optimism
- Billy Graham, Bill Bright, and modern evangelicalism
- The Four Spiritual Laws and democratization of evangelism
- Jacob Neusner and the academic revolution
- "We never repaired that schism for 1800 years"
- N.T. Wright and Kingdom theology
- Quantum science and postmodernity
- The Emerging Church (rejected, but started important conversations)
- Culture wars as "sociological puberty" or "death throes"

**Narrative Purpose**: Show how the 20th century brought both tragedy and hope, culminating in the unprecedented collision of Jewish and Christian scholarship that makes BEMA possible.

## Part Six: Recovery and Hope

### Chapter 11: You Are Here - The Four Pillars
**Theme**: What we lost and what we can recover

**Content Sources**: Episode 203

**Chapter Summary**:
This climactic chapter presents the "Four Pillars of BEMA" - the essential elements from first-century Judaism that we lost and must recover:
1. **TEXT**: Having the Bible IN you, not just on your shelf; the sword of the Spirit
2. **COMMUNITY**: Radical, subversively inclusive fellowship even with those you disagree with
3. **DISCIPLESHIP**: Total immersion into a way of living, not just programs and conferences
4. **WRESTLING**: Questions as doorways to discovery; valuing complexity over formulas

The chapter then turns to hope: the internet gives us unprecedented access to Bible study tools; we have tools to facilitate community like never before; the Jesus-model of discipleship is still effective; postmodern complexity is "incredible opportunity" for wrestling. The chapter concludes with Emmylou Harris's "Time in Babylon" as a prophetic examination of how Empire still holds us captive.

**Key Concepts**:
- The Four Pillars: Text, Community, Discipleship, Wrestling
- "There's a difference between having a Bible on your shelf and having the Bible in you"
- "Radical fellowship with people you don't agree with"
- "Jesus started no churches and went on no missionary journeys. He made disciples."
- "Questions are doorways to discovery, not threats to control"
- Hope for each pillar in our current context
- "Time in Babylon" - recognizing our own captivity to Empire
- "The journey of 1000 miles begins with one step"

**Narrative Purpose**: Move from critique to construction, showing readers what recovery looks like and giving them hope that it's possible.

### Chapter 12: Commissioned and Sent
**Theme**: Benediction, commissioning, and the journey ahead

**Content Sources**: Episode 204

**Chapter Summary**:
The final chapter is a blessing and commissioning for the journey ahead. Drawing on Sarah Bessey's "Benediction" and "Commissioning" from her books, it acknowledges the wilderness of sorting through faith, the mess of half-unpacked boxes, the trail of baggage left behind. But it also declares: "Stop waiting for someone else to validate your created self. That is done." You are commissioned for the work of the gospel, as a minister of Jesus Christ. The book ends not with conclusion but with beginning: "Turn around and face your life. Look it in the eye. Because this, right now, this is it."

**Key Concepts**:
- The wilderness journey and what gets left behind
- Streams in the desert - those who hand you water
- "You're a pioneer, an explorer, an adventurer - carry on"
- Stop waiting for human validation
- "Your ministry begins now, and it began long ago"
- "We are kingdom people, an outpost of redemption"
- "We've been waiting for you"
- Peace be with you

**Narrative Purpose**: Send readers out blessed, commissioned, and hopeful - not with all the answers, but with everything they need to begin.

## Thematic Threads Throughout the Book

### 1. Empire vs. Kingdom
From the five responses to Hellenism through Constantine's Christendom to modern culture wars, the tension between Empire (self-preservation, power, control) and Kingdom (self-sacrifice, blessing others, Shalom) runs through every chapter.

### 2. What We Lost When We Lost Judaism
The schism in AD 114-120 echoes forward through every subsequent development. Each chapter can ask: "Would this have happened if we had maintained connection to our Jewish roots?"

### 3. The Church Leading vs. Following Culture
A crucial turning point occurred when the church stopped driving cultural progress and began trailing behind. This pattern (initiated around Scholasticism) continues through the Copernican conflict, the Enlightenment, the Scopes Trial, and into present day.

### 4. Remnant and Recovery
Even in the darkest chapters, "there's always a remnant." Wycliffe, Hus, Wesley, and countless others maintained faithful witness. This hope thread culminates in the Four Pillars and the unprecedented opportunities of our current moment.

### 5. History Repeating
The church's response to heliocentrism parallels the Scopes Trial, which parallels contemporary science-faith conflicts. A dark history disowned will be repeated. This theme calls readers to honest reckoning and humble learning.

---

## Notes on Structure and Tone

### Narrative Approach
This is a book, not a collection of episode summaries. Each chapter should:
- Open with a compelling hook or question
- Tell a coherent narrative arc
- Include key historical figures and events as characters in the story
- Draw explicit connections to contemporary life
- End with reflection or application

### Honest Critique
Following Marty's model, the book should be unflinching about the dark chapters of Christian history (Crusades, anti-Semitism, abuse of power) while remaining hopeful about what God is doing and can do.

### Not Comprehensive
The book does not attempt to cover all of church history. It intentionally focuses on developments relevant to Western, American, Evangelical Christianity - the context from which BEMA speaks. Other streams need their own storytelling.

### The Text at the Center
Despite being about church history, the book keeps Scripture central. Church history matters because it helps us understand how to apply the Text today.
