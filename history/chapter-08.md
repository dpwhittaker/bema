# Chapter 8: Freedom and Fragmentation

If Copernicus and Galileo rocked the very foundations of Western assumptions about the universe, they were only setting the stage for what we would call today modernity, the modern era.

The one hundred fifty years following the Reformation brought transformations that would have been incomprehensible to earlier generations. Science advanced at unprecedented rates. Political philosophy was rewritten from the ground up. The relationship between church and state, assumed for a thousand years, was fundamentally challenged. And Christianity, for better and for worse, was set free.

This freedom brought both flourishing and fragmentation. It brought new expressions of faith and endless divisions. It brought genuine renewal and the beginning of the end of Christendom.

This is the story of how the modern world was born, and what that birth cost the Church.

## Isaac Newton and the New Physics

If there is a single figure who represents the arrival of modernity, it is Isaac Newton.

Newton is famous for his laws of motion, for the mathematics that describes how objects move and interact. Engineering students have Newton to thank for so much of their field. Every bridge that stays up, every machine that works, every rocket that reaches space depends on physics that Newton articulated.

But Newton did much more. His work on light and color laid foundations for optics. His development of calculus provided mathematics capable of handling change and motion. His entire approach to science, rigorous and mathematical, set the standard for what science would become.

Newton was a person of faith, though his faith was unorthodox. He spent as much time on theology and biblical prophecy as on physics. He saw no conflict between investigating nature and believing in God; to him, studying the creation was a way of knowing the Creator.

But the world Newton described was a world of mechanism, of cause and effect, of forces and motions that could be calculated with precision. It was a world that worked according to laws, laws that humans could discover and understand and use.

This had profound implications. If the natural world operated according to discoverable laws, did it really need constant divine intervention? If effects followed causes with mathematical precision, where was there room for miracles? Newton himself maintained his faith, but the physics he developed pointed toward a universe that could be understood without reference to God.

The Newtonian revolution set the stage for technological advancement like never before. It also set the stage for questions about God that are still being debated today.

## John Locke and the Roots of Liberalism

While Newton was remaking physics, John Locke was remaking political philosophy.

Locke is often called the father of liberalism. In its earliest forms, before the term became politically charged, liberalism meant a philosophy emphasizing liberty and equality. Human beings possessed natural rights. Governments derived their authority from the consent of the governed. Power should be limited and divided. The purpose of government was to protect the rights of citizens, not to rule over them.

These ideas sound familiar because they shaped the modern world. Locke's influence on the American Declaration of Independence is unmistakable. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness echo Locke's natural rights. Government by consent of the governed comes directly from his political theory. The entire structure of American democracy bears his stamp.

Locke was not attacking Christianity. He was a person of faith who saw his political philosophy as compatible with, even derived from, Christian principles. His arguments about natural rights were grounded in creation theology: humans have rights because God made them a certain way.

But the implications of his ideas went further than he may have intended. If government authority derives from the consent of the governed, what about church authority? If power should be limited and divided, what about papal power? If people possess natural rights, can any institution, even the Church, override those rights?

Locke opened doors that could not be closed. And the world that walked through those doors looked very different from the one that had preceded it.

## American Democracy and the Balance of Philosophies

American democracy works, on its good days, because of a tension and balance held between liberalism and conservatism. One philosophy bent toward complete freedom. The other bent toward maintaining constant ethics.

This balance was intentional. The founders understood that pure freedom without constraint leads to chaos, while pure constraint without freedom leads to tyranny. They built a system designed to hold these impulses in productive tension.

This is relevant to our story because Christianity in America would be shaped by these political conditions. Freedom of religion meant freedom to form new churches, to develop new theologies, to experiment with new expressions of faith. It also meant freedom to fragment, to divide, to multiply denominations into the thousands.

The political structure that made American Christianity possible also made American Christianity fractured. The same freedom that allowed genuine renewal also allowed every individual with a Bible and an opinion to start their own movement.

We will explore this in more detail in later chapters. For now, it is enough to note that the ideas planted by thinkers like Locke were already bearing fruit, fruit that tasted of both liberty and disintegration.

## The Edict of Nantes: Protestant Freedom

In 1598, King Henry IV of France signed the Edict of Nantes, granting Protestants civil liberty and equality. After decades of brutal religious warfare, Protestants would no longer be hunted as heretics under the oppression of Catholic authorities. They could worship according to their conscience. They could hold civil office. They could live without fear.

This was a profound turning point. For the first time in Western Europe, the principle of religious tolerance was enshrined in law. The assumption that a kingdom must have one faith, enforced by the state, was beginning to crack.

The effects were immediate and contradictory.

On the positive side, Protestant freedom allowed people to think for themselves, to study and publish and teach their theological beliefs. No longer constrained by fear of persecution, Protestant thinkers could develop their ideas openly. Scholarship flourished. Education expanded. The life of the mind became possible for those outside the Catholic establishment.

But there was a negative side as well. Protestantism no longer had a central system holding it together. The Catholic Church, for all its problems, provided a structure of unity. The Pope could settle disputes. Councils could establish doctrine. There was an authority to appeal to when Christians disagreed.

Without that central authority, Protestants were free to disagree endlessly. And they did.

The lowercase-c catholic element, the universality that held Christians together across time and space, began to dissolve. As Europe splintered politically and migration increased, mass division and splitting of Christian thought accelerated. This fragmentation would increase exponentially over the next two hundred years.

Not that diversity is necessarily bad. There is something beautiful about different expressions of the same faith, different emphases and traditions and communities. But the splitting was not always about genuine theological difference. It was often about personality and power, about national identity and political convenience, about the simple inability of strong-willed people to get along.

The Reformation had set Christianity free. But freedom, it turns out, is complicated.

## John Wesley and the Methodist Revival

Breaking from the Anglican establishment, John Wesley became the father of Methodism.

Wesley was not interested in founding a new denomination. He saw himself as calling Anglicanism back to its roots, back to genuine faith and practice. But his movement outgrew its original boundaries, and Methodism became one of the most influential Protestant traditions in the English-speaking world.

Wesley emphasized personal transformation. Against the Calvinist emphasis on divine sovereignty and predestination, Wesley preached the power of human will to respond to God's grace. He called people to personal repentance, to confession, to the pursuit of holiness.

And he modeled something crucial: discipleship.

Wesley organized his followers into small groups, classes and bands, where they met regularly to encourage one another, confess struggles, and hold each other accountable. This was not program or curriculum. It was apprenticeship, formation through relationship.

Before we become too critical of this era, we should acknowledge what Wesley recovered. His commitment to discipleship, to the methodical practice of spiritual disciplines, to the transformation of the whole person, represents something that Christianity too often loses.

There is a book called Rediscovering Discipleship by Robby Gallaty that traces this history. It is worth reading if you want to understand what Wesley accomplished and what the church has too often forgotten.

Wesley reminds us that even in periods of fragmentation, genuine renewal was happening. The Spirit was moving. Lives were being changed. The Gospel was being preached with power.

The story of this era is not only decline. It is also awakening.

## Voltaire and the Critique of Christendom

While Wesley was preaching revival in England, a very different voice was rising in France.

Voltaire, the pen name of Francois-Marie Arouet, was a writer and philosopher who became famous for his satirical attacks on the Catholic Church and established religion in general. His wit was sharp. His criticism was devastating. His influence on European intellectual culture was immense.

Voltaire was quick to point out, accurately, the danger of religion when mixed with the power of the state.

This is important. Voltaire was not wrong.

We have traced this danger throughout our story. The Crusades slaughtered people in Jesus's name. The Inquisition tortured heretics to save their souls. Religious wars had devastated Europe. Everywhere that Christianity held political power, there was evidence of that power being abused.

Voltaire saw the danger of Christendom and its negative implications. He argued for freedom of religion, not because he loved religion but because he saw that state-enforced religion was worse than no enforcement at all. He championed freedom of speech because he saw what happened when authorities could silence dissent.

His ideas, shaped by what he saw of Christian Europe, would eventually become the principle we know as separation of church and state.

Christians often react defensively to critics like Voltaire. We want to defend our faith, to protect the Church's reputation, to argue that the abuses were aberrations rather than the norm.

But perhaps we should listen more carefully.

Voltaire's critique was accurate. When religion mixes with state power, terrible things tend to happen. When the Church has the ability to coerce, it tends to use that ability in ways that betray Jesus. When faith is enforced rather than chosen, it becomes something other than faith.

Separation of church and state protects the church as much as it protects the state. It prevents Christianity from becoming a tool of political power. It forces the Gospel to be proclaimed rather than imposed. It creates space for genuine faith rather than compelled conformity.

Voltaire helped birth that separation. Christians can be grateful for it, even if Voltaire's motives were not those we would share.

## The French Revolution and the Post-Christian Era

All these forces, scientific revolution, political philosophy, religious critique, Protestant fragmentation, came together in the French Revolution of 1789.

The Revolution overthrew not only the French monarchy but the entire structure of Catholic Christendom in France. Churches were closed or converted to secular purposes. Priests were forced to swear loyalty to the state or face execution. The calendar itself was remade to eliminate Christian holidays. The Revolution declared war on Christianity as thoroughly as it declared war on aristocracy.

This was the birth of what we might call the post-Christian era.

Here is what that means. Before the French Revolution, if you could unplug the world and plug it back in, it would blink Christian as default. The assumptions of culture, the structure of society, the calendar and the holidays and the common moral framework all derived from Christianity. To be European was, in some sense, to be Christian.

After the French Revolution, the world shifted and tilted away from that reality. If you unplugged the world and plugged it back in, it no longer blinked Christian. It blinked something else: secular culture, post-Christian assumptions, a framework that no longer depended on faith.

This shift did not happen everywhere at once. It reached some places sooner than others. America, in particular, retained Christian cultural assumptions longer than Europe. But the direction was set. The tide was turning.

The Church would continue to see decline in its influence, both politically and culturally. It would continue to lose the privilege it had enjoyed for a millennium. And much of the Church is still in denial about this to this very day.

Especially the fundamentalist evangelical movement that many of us call home.

## The Westward Migration of Power

If you trace the names and places we have discussed in recent chapters, a geographical pattern emerges.

Luther was German, in the eastern part of Western Europe. Calvin was French but ended up in Geneva. Knox was Scottish. Wesley was English. Newton was English. Locke was English. Voltaire was French.

The center of power and influence was moving. Away from Rome. Away from the Mediterranean world that had been the center of civilization for millennia. Toward northwestern Europe. Toward the Atlantic.

And soon, across that ocean, to America.

The cultural wave was moving westward. The thinkers who shaped modernity were increasingly found in England and France and the Netherlands. The ideas that would birth the modern world were gestating in Protestant and post-Protestant cultures, far from Rome's influence.

This is not coincidental. The Reformation had broken Rome's monopoly on Western Christianity. The scientific revolution had decentered Rome's cosmology. The Enlightenment critique had targeted Rome's fusion of church and state. Everything was moving away from the ancient center toward new ones.

America would be the ultimate beneficiary of this westward movement. A nation founded on Enlightenment principles, shaped by Protestant diversity, freed from the weight of medieval history, America would become something new in Christian history.

But that is a story for the next chapter. For now, we must sit with the reality of what freedom had wrought.

## Still in Denial

The post-Christian era began more than two hundred years ago. And much of the Church is still in denial about it.

We still expect cultural privilege. We still assume that being Christian should give us influence and respect. We still act surprised when secular society does not defer to our moral authority. We still fight culture wars as if the culture was still ours to fight for.

But the world changed. The Christendom that ruled for a thousand years is gone. The default settings have been reset. We are no longer the assumed center of Western civilization.

This is not necessarily bad news. The early Church had no political power and no cultural privilege. It grew anyway. As Jesus promised, "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35, NIV). The Gospel spread through testimony and love, through communities that lived differently, through the power of a message that needed no enforcement because it was true and beautiful and good.

Perhaps losing Christendom is an opportunity to recover Christianity. Perhaps the end of cultural privilege is the beginning of genuine witness. Perhaps the collapse of the empire is the condition for the kingdom.

But we cannot embrace this opportunity while we are still in denial. We cannot move forward while we are clinging to the past. We cannot become who we are called to be while we are still mourning what we used to have.

The post-Christian era is where we live. It is the soil in which we must plant the Gospel. It is the context in which we must learn to be faithful.

## Freedom and Fragmentation: The Double Gift

Freedom brought flourishing. It brought Wesley's revival and Newton's physics and Locke's philosophy of rights. It brought the ability to think and publish and worship according to conscience. It brought genuine advances in human knowledge and human dignity.

Freedom also brought fragmentation. It brought endless denominational splitting and theological controversy and the loss of any visible Christian unity. It brought the conditions that made secular critique possible and Christian influence diminishable.

We cannot have one without the other. Freedom is a double gift. It allows us to choose well and to choose poorly, to unite and to divide, to grow and to fracture.

The Protestant Reformation set this process in motion. The Edict of Nantes accelerated it. The Enlightenment critiqued it. The French Revolution transformed it. And we are still living with the consequences.

As we move into the American chapter of our story, we will see this dynamic intensified. American freedom will produce both the best and the worst of Protestant Christianity. Awakening and aberration will coexist. Renewal and regression will proceed together.

But that is for the next chapter. For now, let us acknowledge where we have arrived.

The medieval world is over. Christendom is ending. The Church is no longer driving culture but being pulled along by it. Science and politics and philosophy have their own momentum now, and the Church is learning, awkwardly and painfully, how to be faithful in a world it does not control.

This is our inheritance. This is our challenge. This is the context in which we must learn to follow Jesus.

May we have the wisdom to accept what we cannot change, the courage to pursue what we can, and the discernment to know the difference.
