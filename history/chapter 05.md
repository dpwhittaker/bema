# Chapter 5: A Dark Chapter We Must Own

Nothing brings people together like a common enemy.

This is not a virtue. It is a confession. And it describes precisely what happened to Western Christendom in the centuries following the Great East-West Schism of 1054. The Church was fractured, the papacy was weakened, and Christianity in Europe desperately needed something to restore its sense of purpose. It found that something in an enemy.

The Islamic world had been expanding for centuries, and by the end of the first millennium, Muslim forces controlled the Holy Land, including Jerusalem. For the feudal powers of Europe and the beleaguered Church authorities struggling to maintain unity, this presented what appeared to be a perfect opportunity. A common enemy. A righteous cause. A way to channel the restless violence of European nobility toward something that looked holy.

And so began the Crusades.

## The Wars We Prefer Not to Discuss

The Crusades lasted roughly two hundred years, from 1095 when Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade, through the fall of Acre in 1291. During that time, European Christians launched at least nine major military campaigns to capture and hold Jerusalem and the surrounding regions. They built massive fortresses. They established crusader kingdoms. They slaughtered tens of thousands of people.

Let us be direct about what happened. The Crusades were largely unsuccessful by any measuring stick except one: they were extraordinarily successful at killing people. Muslim, Jewish, and Eastern Christian civilians died in staggering numbers. The sack of Jerusalem in 1099 left the streets running with blood. The Fourth Crusade never even reached the Holy Land; instead, the crusaders sacked Constantinople, the center of Eastern Christianity, in 1204.

There is no positive spin to put on this history.

The stated objectives of the Crusades were never accomplished in any lasting way. Jerusalem changed hands repeatedly. The crusader kingdoms eventually fell. The schism between Eastern and Western Christianity deepened into permanent rupture. The relationship between Christians and Muslims was poisoned for centuries. The reputation of Jesus was smeared with blood that has never fully washed away.

And yet, in a twisted way, the Crusades accomplished what the Church leadership needed most at that moment: they unified a fragmenting Christendom around a shared purpose. Nothing brings people together like a common enemy. The tragedy is that this principle works.

## Who Fights the Wars?

When we tell the story of the Crusades, we often focus on kings and popes, on Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, on strategy and theology. But there is another story that rarely gets told, and it is the story of who actually did the fighting and dying.

It was not the wealthy.

It was not the powerful.

It was not the decision-makers.

The poor and the desperate did the fighting. The landless second sons who would inherit nothing. The peasants who were offered forgiveness of debts and sins in exchange for taking up the cross. The common people who were promised riches they would never live to collect.

This is a pattern as old as Empire itself. The powerful make the decisions about war. They offer ridiculous sums of money to recruit soldiers. They make grand speeches about honor and glory and God's will. And then they send other people's children to die, knowing that many of those promises will never need to be kept because the promisees will not survive to collect.

We studied this pattern in the first session of our journey, when we examined Egypt and the nature of Empire. We saw how Pharaoh used stick rather than invitation, how Empire operates through force and fear and the threat of death. We identified the contrast between Empire and Shalom, between the way of coercion and the way of blessing.

The Crusades represent Empire, not Shalom. This is Egypt. This is Pharaoh. There is nothing of Jesus in raising an army to slaughter your way to a holy city. There is nothing of the Cross in conquest.

And yet this was done in Jesus's name. By his followers. With the blessing of his Church.

## The Problem of Christian Memory

Here is where we must wrestle with something uncomfortable about how Christians tend to handle their own history.

Ask many Christians why they should care about the Crusades, and you will often receive a version of this response: "Why would I apologize for something that happened centuries ago? I wasn't there. I didn't do it. That has nothing to do with me."

This response reveals a profound disconnect from the faith we claim to follow.

Consider how Jewish memory works. At every Passover seder, Jewish families recite the story of the Exodus. But they do not say, "Our ancestors were slaves in Egypt." They say, "WE were slaves in Egypt. WE crossed the Red Sea. WE received the Torah at Sinai."

Jewish identity is fundamentally connected to Jewish history. Every generation enters the story, not as spectators, but as participants. The triumphs and the tragedies, the faithfulness and the failures all belong to everyone who claims the identity.

Christians claim to have been grafted into this story through Jesus. We claim Abraham as our father. We claim the prophets as our own. We celebrate the victories of Israel as our victories.

But when it comes to the dark chapters? Suddenly we become individualists. "That wasn't me. That was someone else."

This selective memory is not merely inconsistent; it is dangerous. A dark history disowned by the descendants of it will be bound to repeat itself.

## What Jews See When They See Jesus

On a trip to Israel, a group of Christian pilgrims asked their Jewish guide a question that Christians often ask: Why don't Jews follow Jesus?

The guide's response has stayed with me ever since.

"We as Jews have never been able to understand how Christians can see Jesus in a vacuum," he said. "We can't see Jesus just as this independent Jewish rabbi 2,000 years ago. For us, Jesus is connected to 1,800 years of brutal Church history, much of which has been filled with the slaughter of people in the name of this Jesus."

This is not anti-Christian prejudice. This is honest observation. This is what happens when you have been on the receiving end of Christian swords, Christian pogroms, Christian expulsions, Christian forced conversions, for nearly two millennia.

Jews cannot see Jesus apart from what his followers have done in his name. And what his followers have done in his name includes the Crusades, which massacred Jewish communities across Europe on the way to massacre Muslim communities in the East. It includes the Inquisition. It includes countless local persecutions. It includes eventually, horrifyingly, the Holocaust, which happened in the heart of Christian Europe.

When we refuse to own this history, we are asking our Jewish neighbors to pretend it didn't happen. We are asking them to see Jesus in a vacuum, detached from everything that came after him.

They cannot do that. And honestly, they shouldn't have to.

If we want anyone to see Jesus clearly, we must first be honest about how badly his followers have obscured him.

## The Rise of Scholasticism

While the poor and the desperate were fighting and dying in the Holy Land, something else was happening in Europe. The educated elite, safe behind their castle walls and monastery libraries, were pursuing knowledge.

This was the age of Scholasticism.

Universities emerged across Europe, offering systematic education in theology, philosophy, mathematics, and the sciences. Students apprenticed to masters, learning the great works of Greek philosophy alongside Christian doctrine. A new intellectual culture was forming.

At the center of this movement stood Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican friar whose systematic approach to theology would shape Western Christianity for centuries. Aquinas brought Aristotelian logic to bear on Christian doctrine, creating comprehensive syntheses of faith and reason. He organized knowledge into neat categories. He answered questions with systematic precision. He is often called the father of logic and reason in Christian thought.

Aquinas's influence cannot be overstated. The educational systems we use today still bear his stamp. The way we think about the relationship between faith and reason, the categories we use to organize theology, the very structure of academic discourse in the West all trace back to his work.

But there is a shadow side to this story.

As Scholasticism rose, a gap widened between those who had access to education and those who did not. The wealthy and privileged studied in universities. The poor and common continued in illiteracy, dependent on priests to tell them what God said and what God wanted.

The Church was becoming two churches: one for the educated elite who could read Latin and debate fine points of theology, and one for the masses who could do neither. This gap would continue to widen for centuries, creating conditions that would eventually demand reformation.

## A Thousand Years from Jesus

By the time of the Crusades and Scholasticism, Christianity was approximately one thousand years removed from its origins as a Jewish movement following a Jewish rabbi.

One thousand years.

Consider what had been lost in that millennium.

The Jewish roots of the faith had been severed almost at the beginning, in those terrible years of persecution when Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish brothers and sisters to save themselves. The walking libraries of Torah had been cut off. The context that made sense of Jesus's teaching had been replaced by Greek philosophy. Gnosticism had shaped the categories of Christian thought. Hellenism had become the water in which the faith swam.

By the year 1200, the followers of Jesus no longer had any meaningful connection to the world Jesus inhabited. They read the Scriptures in Latin, not Hebrew or Greek. They interpreted them through categories borrowed from Aristotle and Plato, not from the rabbis. They organized their communities through hierarchical bureaucracy, not through the intimate discipleship circles Jesus had modeled.

We are still enamored with the pillars of Hellenism today. We still organize our churches and our seminaries along Scholastic lines. We still debate fine points of doctrine while neglecting the practices of daily life. We still create gaps between educated clergy and uneducated laity.

The question we must ask is: how lost had we become? And the answer, when we look honestly at the Crusades, is: very lost indeed.

## Owning the Darkness

There is a chapter in Donald Miller's book Blue Like Jazz that tells the story of a group of Christians at Reed College, one of the most secular campuses in America. Instead of setting up a booth to argue with skeptics, they built a reverse confessional. They invited people in not to confess their sins but to hear Christians confess the sins of the Church.

They confessed the Crusades. They confessed the Inquisition. They confessed colonialism and slavery and the countless ways Christians have harmed people in Jesus's name. They confessed both historic wrongs and contemporary ones.

Many Christians, when they hear this story, are uncomfortable. Why would we apologize for things we didn't do? Why would we take responsibility for sins that aren't ours?

But this discomfort reveals how far we have drifted from the pattern of Scripture itself. The prophets of Israel confessed the sins of their ancestors. Daniel included himself in the confession even though he had not personally committed the sins. "We have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned away from your commands and laws" (Daniel 9:5, NIV), he prayed, using the first-person plural.

This is how covenant communities work. We are connected to those who came before us. Their story is our story. Their sins have shaped the conditions in which we live and move and have our being.

When we refuse to own the dark chapters, we cut ourselves off from the possibility of genuine repentance. And without genuine repentance, we cut ourselves off from genuine transformation.

A dark history disowned will be repeated.

## Defining Others by Their Extremists

There is one more lesson we must take from this chapter of history, and it concerns how we talk about people who are different from us.

Christians often object to being defined by our worst moments. When someone points to the Crusades or the Inquisition or the abuse scandals in modern churches, we respond: "That's not what Christianity is really about. Those people weren't real Christians. You can't judge a faith by its worst adherents."

Fair enough. But do we extend the same grace to others?

When we think about Islam, do we think about the long tradition of scholarship, art, and hospitality? Or do we think about terrorism and violence? Do we judge Islam by its saints or by its villains?

The expansion of Islam toward Palestine was not uniquely violent for its time. It did not represent the Islamic faith as a whole any more than the Crusades represented the Christian faith as a whole. Both religions have their examples of brutality. Both have their examples of mercy and wisdom and beauty.

We cannot expect others to see Jesus clearly past the violence of Christian history if we refuse to see Mohammed clearly past the violence of Islamic history. We cannot ask for grace we are unwilling to give.

## This Is Empire

Let us return to where we began. Nothing brings people together like a common enemy.

The Crusades worked, in the narrow sense that they temporarily unified Western Christendom. But they worked the way Empire always works: through fear, through violence, through the creation of an enemy to hate.

This is not the way of Jesus.

Jesus unified people not through shared hatred but through shared love. He brought together tax collectors and zealots, Pharisees and sinners, by calling them all into a different kind of community. He conquered not by killing his enemies but by dying for them. As Paul wrote, "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8, NIV).

The Church of the Crusades had forgotten this. It had become so enmeshed with Empire that it could not imagine any other way of operating. When faced with a fragmenting institution, it reached for the tool that empires always reach for: the sword.

And in reaching for the sword, it forfeited something precious. It forfeited the ability to be distinguished from every other power-hungry institution in history. It forfeited the moral authority to speak of a God who loves his enemies. It forfeited the trust of the very people it claimed to be saving.

## What Remains

So what do we do with this chapter of our history?

We own it. All of it.

We acknowledge that these were our people, our predecessors in faith. We acknowledge that the same impulses that drove them toward violence exist within us. We acknowledge that the logic of Empire is always available, always tempting, always promising that just a little more force will finally bring peace.

We practice honest confession, not because we are personally guilty but because we are part of a community whose story includes both light and darkness.

We listen to those who have been harmed. We listen to our Jewish neighbors who cannot see Jesus apart from Christian violence. We listen to our Muslim neighbors who remember what crusaders did. We listen to indigenous peoples around the world who experienced Christian conquest. We do not argue with their pain or minimize their memories.

And we commit to a different way forward.

The Crusades showed us what happens when the Church grasps for power. It showed us what happens when we define ourselves by what we oppose rather than by what we love. It showed us the bitter fruit of Empire theology.

We cannot change what happened. But we can refuse to repeat it. We can choose Shalom over Empire, invitation over coercion, the Cross over the sword.

A thousand years from the Jewish movement of Jesus, the Church had lost almost everything essential. But even in the darkest chapters, there is always a remnant. There are always those who remember a better way. There are always voices crying out for return.

As we move forward in our story, we will meet some of those voices. But first, we needed to sit in the darkness long enough to understand why reform was so desperately needed.

This is the chapter of Christian history we must own. Not to wallow in guilt, but to learn. Not to despair, but to change. Because a dark history owned is a dark history that need not be repeated.

May we have the courage to own it.
