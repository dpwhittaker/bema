# Week 3: Long-Term Consequences and the Glimmer of Hope

## Church History as Preface to Deconstructing Systematic Theology

### Opening Question
Can the church repent of corporate sin? What does it mean to take responsibility for atrocities committed by Christians centuries ago? And is there hope for healing a wound 1,800 years in the making?

---

## Part 1: From Theology to Violence

### The Logic of Christian Anti-Semitism
Remember the pattern from Weeks 1 and 2:
1. Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish family (AD 114-120)
2. To justify the betrayal, they had to make Jews the villains
3. Without Jewish teachers, Gnostic ideas filled the vacuum
4. Councils formulated doctrine using Greek categories, without Jewish input
5. The "Christ-killer" narrative hardened into Christian teaching
6. Jews were blamed for rejecting and murdering their own Messiah

**The Theological Foundation:**
By the medieval period, Christian theology taught:
- Jews rejected Jesus and had him crucified
- God rejected the Jews and replaced them with the church (**supersessionism**)
- The destruction of the Temple (AD 70) was divine punishment
- Jewish suffering was just punishment for deicide (killing God)
- Jews were in spiritual blindness, worshiping the devil
- Converting Jews was a mercy; persecuting them was righteous judgment

**The Forgotten Reality:**
All of this conveniently forgot that:
- Jesus was Jewish
- All the apostles were Jewish
- The first church was entirely Jewish
- Gentiles were grafted in, not substituted
- Jesus himself prayed from the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34)

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Supersessionism taught that God rejected the Jews and replaced them with the church. Romans 9-11 explicitly denies this: "God has not rejected his people" (Romans 11:2). How did the church teach supersessionism for 1,800 years despite Paul's clear rejection of it?

2. The text argues that bad theology leads to violence. Can you draw a line from the creeds (Week 2) to the Crusades and Holocaust? How does theology shape practice?

3. We've traced a pattern: betrayal → loss of Jewish context → Gnostic infiltration → councils without Jewish input → creeds in Greek categories → schisms over those creeds → violence justified by theology. If this pattern is accurate, what does it mean for systematic theology as we've inherited it?

## Part 2: Pogroms and Forced Conversions

### Medieval Jewish Life
Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews in Christian Europe faced:
- Forced segregation into ghettos
- Restrictions on professions (could not own land, join guilds)
- Forced to wear identifying badges or hats
- Subjected to special taxes
- Forbidden to testify against Christians in court
- Blamed for plagues, droughts, and disasters

### The Blood Libel
A particularly vicious lie emerged: Jews kidnapped Christian children to use their blood in Passover rituals. This "blood libel" had no basis in reality (Jewish law strictly forbids consuming blood), but it provided excuse for massacre after massacre.

**The Pattern:**
1. A child goes missing or dies
2. Jews are accused of ritual murder
3. Mob violence erupts
4. Jewish communities are destroyed
5. Survivors are expelled or forced to convert
6. Church authorities sometimes condemned the violence after the fact
7. The pattern repeats in the next town

### Forced Conversions
Jews faced a choice:
- **Convert** to Christianity (become a *converso* or *marrano*)
- **Leave** their homes, businesses, and communities
- **Die** in pogroms

Many chose conversion to save their families. But even *conversos* were never fully trusted—the Inquisition would later target them specifically, suspecting them of secretly practicing Judaism.

**The Theological Irony:**
Christianity teaches that faith cannot be coerced, that genuine conversion requires free choice. Yet the church forced conversions through violence and threat, then punished those whose conversions were deemed insufficiently sincere.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Before this class, how much did you know about Christian persecution of Jews? Why do you think this history is not commonly taught in churches?

2. The Spanish Inquisition targeted *conversos*—Jews who had converted to Christianity. What does this reveal about the impossibility of Jewish existence in Christian Europe? If you can't win by refusing to convert and can't win by converting, what options are left?

## Part 3: The Crusades (1095-1291)

### "Nothing Brings People Together Like a Common Enemy"
Pope Urban II called the First Crusade in 1095 to recapture Jerusalem from Muslim control. He promised:
- Remission of sins for crusaders
- Eternal reward for those who died in holy war
- Adventure, plunder, and land

Tens of thousands answered the call.

### Who Actually Fought
Not kings and knights—at least not primarily. The Crusades drew:
- The poor, promised relief from debt and new opportunities
- Second sons with no inheritance
- Criminals offered pardons
- The desperate and dispossessed

**The Empire Pattern:**
Empire always sends the powerless to fight its wars while the powerful stay safely home. The Crusades were no exception.

### The Rhineland Massacres (1096)
Before the First Crusade even reached Jerusalem, crusaders turned on Jews in Europe.

The logic was simple: "Why travel thousands of miles to fight the infidel when there are infidels right here? Let's kill the Christ-killers before we leave."

**The Massacres:**
- Speyer, Germany: Jewish community attacked
- Worms, Germany: 800 Jews murdered
- Mainz, Germany: Over 1,000 Jews killed
- Cologne, Trier, Metz: More massacres

Some bishops tried to protect Jews. Most did not. In many cases, Jews were offered the same choice as always: convert or die. Many chose mass suicide rather than forced baptism.

**Jewish Historical Memory:**
Jews remember the Crusades as one of the darkest periods in their history. Christians often remember the Crusades as glorious adventures. This difference in memory matters.

### Jerusalem 1099
When crusaders finally captured Jerusalem, they slaughtered everyone:
- Muslims killed in the streets
- Jews burned alive in their synagogue
- Eastern Christians killed because they looked like Muslims
- Blood reportedly flowed ankle-deep

The crusaders then attended Mass to thank God for their victory.

### Later Crusades
The Crusades continued for two centuries:
- The Fourth Crusade (1204) sacked Constantinople—*fellow Christians*
- The Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229) massacred Cathars in southern France
- The Northern Crusades forced conversion of Baltic pagans

**The Pattern:**
Once you establish that violence in Christ's name is acceptable, once you divide the world into "us" (saved) and "them" (damned), once you make orthodoxy a matter of life and death, the killing spreads. Muslims, Jews, heretics, schismatics—anyone who fails the test.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Crusades are often romanticized in Christian culture (movies, books, church names). Jewish people remember them as massacres. Why does this difference in memory matter?

2. Once you establish that violence in Christ's name is acceptable, the killing spreads to different groups. Where do you see this pattern today?

## Part 4: The Inquisition (1231-1834)

### Enforcing Orthodoxy
The Medieval Inquisition was established to root out heresy in Christian Europe. Later versions included:
- The Spanish Inquisition (1478-1834)
- The Portuguese Inquisition (1536-1821)
- The Roman Inquisition (1542-1860)

**The Method:**
- Accused heretics were investigated
- Torture was used to extract confessions
- Those who recanted might be spared (but lived under suspicion)
- Those who refused to recant were executed, usually by burning
- Property of the condemned was confiscated by church and state

### Targeting Conversos
The Spanish Inquisition particularly targeted *conversos*—Jews who had converted to Christianity, often under duress.

**The Suspicion:**
Even after conversion, even after generations, Christians suspected *conversos* of secretly practicing Judaism. The Inquisition:
- Spied on families to see if they lit Sabbath candles
- Investigated food practices (avoiding pork, keeping kosher)
- Questioned neighbors about observance of Jewish holidays
- Tortured suspects to confess

**The Impossibility:**
If you refused to convert, you were killed for being Jewish. If you converted, you were suspected of being secretly Jewish and investigated by the Inquisition. There was no safe path.

### The Spanish Expulsion (1492)
In 1492—the same year Columbus sailed—Ferdinand and Isabella issued the Alhambra Decree:
- All Jews must convert to Christianity or leave Spain
- They had four months to decide
- They could not take gold or silver with them
- An estimated 100,000-200,000 Jews fled

Many died during the flight. Those who survived became refugees, scattered across Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire.

**The Irony:**
Spain expelled its Jewish population in the name of Catholic purity. Spain's economy suffered terribly as a result, losing skilled workers, merchants, and financiers. Within a generation, Spain's golden age was over.

**The Lesson Ignored:**
When you expel the people you've oppressed, you don't just lose their contributions—you lose the chance to repent, to make amends, to heal. Spain chose purity over justice, and everyone suffered.

## Part 5: The Holocaust (1933-1945)

### The Culmination of Christian Anti-Semitism
The Holocaust was not a departure from Christian history. It was its horrifying culmination.

**Hitler's Innovations:**
- Industrial-scale murder (gas chambers, death camps)
- Bureaucratic efficiency (railroad logistics, record-keeping)
- Scientific racism (eugenics, racial hygiene)
- Modern technology in service of ancient hatred

**But the Foundation Was Already Laid:**
- 1,800 years of Christian teaching that Jews were Christ-killers
- Centuries of sermons blaming Jews for every evil
- Legal restrictions that made Jews vulnerable
- Theological supersessionism that said God had rejected the Jews
- A pattern of dehumanization that made genocide thinkable

**Martin Luther's "On the Jews and Their Lies" (1543):**
Luther, hero of the Reformation, wrote:
> "First, their synagogues should be set on fire... Secondly, their homes should likewise be broken down and destroyed... Thirdly, they should be deprived of their prayer books and Talmuds... Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death to teach anymore..."

The Nazis quoted Luther. They built on Christian anti-Semitism. They implemented what Christian theology had been teaching for centuries.

### Six Million
- Six million Jews murdered
- 1.5 million children
- Entire communities erased
- Yiddish culture nearly destroyed
- Families torn apart
- A wound beyond words

**The Silence:**
Many Christians across Europe:
- Looked the other way
- Collaborated with Nazis
- Turned in Jewish neighbors
- Stole Jewish property
- Participated in the killing

Some Christians were righteous:
- Hid Jews in their homes
- Forged documents
- Smuggled children to safety
- Risked their lives to save others

But they were the exception, not the rule.

**The Question That Will Not Go Away:**
How could the Holocaust happen in Christian Europe? How could the people who sang "Jesus loves the little children" murder 1.5 million Jewish children?

The answer: because Christian theology had taught for 1,800 years that Jews were cursed, rejected, deserving of suffering. The Holocaust did not come out of nowhere. It came out of us.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The text argues that the Holocaust was the culmination of 1,800 years of Christian anti-Semitism, not a departure from it. Do you agree? How much responsibility does Christian theology bear for the Holocaust?

2. Martin Luther wrote viciously anti-Semitic material in 1543. The Nazis quoted him. Should Protestants reckon with Luther's legacy differently? Can we honor his contributions to the Reformation while condemning his anti-Semitism?

3. Many Christians across Europe participated in or enabled the Holocaust. Some risked their lives to save Jews. What made the difference? Can we identify theological factors that led to resistance vs. collaboration?

---

## Part 6: The Glimmer of Hope

### Confronting the Horror
After World War II, Christians could no longer avoid the question: What role did our theology play in the Holocaust?

Some refused to ask. They blamed Hitler, blamed Germany, blamed paganism, blamed everything except the anti-Semitism embedded in Christian teaching.

But others looked honestly at the history and were horrified by what they saw.

### Vatican II and Nostra Aetate (1965)

**The Catholic Church's Response:**
In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued *Nostra Aetate* (In Our Time), a declaration on the relationship between the Catholic Church and non-Christian religions.

**Regarding Jews, it declared:**
1. The Jewish people are not collectively responsible for Jesus's death
2. Jews are not rejected or cursed by God
3. The church decries hatred and persecution of Jews
4. Anti-Semitism is condemned

**The Significance:**
For the first time in 1,800 years, the Catholic Church officially repudiated supersessionism and theological anti-Semitism. This was not a minor adjustment—it was a fundamental reorientation.

**What It Said:**
> "True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures."

**What It Meant:**
- The "Christ-killer" charge is false
- Jews are still in covenant with God
- Christians must oppose anti-Semitism
- Dialogue and reconciliation are possible

### Protestant Responses
Protestant denominations issued similar statements:
- Presbyterian Church (USA) repudiated supersessionism
- Evangelical Lutheran Church in America renounced Luther's anti-Semitic writings
- United Methodist Church affirmed God's covenant with the Jewish people
- Many others followed

**The Common Thread:**
After the Holocaust, churches began to acknowledge that Christian theology had contributed to Jewish suffering. They began to repent.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Vatican II's *Nostra Aetate* (1965) officially repudiated the "Christ-killer" charge and supersessionism. Why did it take until 1965? What changed after the Holocaust that made this possible?

2. The text asks: "Can the church repent of corporate sin?" What would that repentance look like? Is it meaningful to apologize for sins committed by Christians centuries ago?

3. Since 1965, churches have been issuing statements condemning anti-Semitism and repudiating supersessionism. Is this enough? What else needs to happen for healing?

## Part 7: The Door Opens for Healing

### Jacob Neusner and the Academic Revolution (1970s)
Around the same time that churches were repudiating anti-Semitism, something remarkable happened in academic scholarship.

**Jacob Neusner** (1932-2016):
- Jewish literary scholar with Orthodox roots
- Brought Christian scholars to the table with Jewish scholars
- Studied how modern Christian thought influenced Jewish thought
- Opened a dialogue that had been closed for 1,800 years

**The Breakthrough:**
Academic Christians began learning from Jewish scholars:
- How to read the Hebrew Bible in its original context
- The Jewishness of Jesus and Paul
- Rabbinic methods of interpretation
- The richness of Second Temple Judaism

**The Rediscovery:**
> "We never repaired that schism for 1,800 years. We went down our own stream of thought, our own stream of consciousness. We had councils and reformations and great movements, but they were all very Gentile. Now, 1,800 years later, these two worlds collide again, this Jewish and Gentile world, on a scholastic level, on an academic level in the world of scholarship." —Marty Solomon, BEMA Podcast

**The Questions We Didn't Know We Weren't Asking:**
For 1,800 years, Christians approached Scripture without asking basic questions about Jewish context because we didn't have Jewish teachers to teach us what questions to ask.

Now, for the first time since the schism, the questions are being asked again.

### The Recovery Begins
Modern scholarship recovering Jewish roots of Christianity:
- **E.P. Sanders**: *Paul and Palestinian Judaism* (1977)
- **N.T. Wright**: Kingdom theology rooted in Second Temple Judaism
- **Amy-Jill Levine**: Jewish perspectives on Jesus and the New Testament
- **Daniel Boyarin**: Border lines between Judaism and Christianity
- Countless others

**What's Being Recovered:**
- The Jewishness of Jesus's teachings
- Paul's thoroughly Jewish theology
- The cultural context of the Gospels
- The continuity between Old and New Testaments
- The Hebrew worldview underlying Christian Scripture

**The BEMA Podcast:**
> "BEMA is not just indebted—this whole discussion would not happen without the work of Jacob Neusner, period." —Marty Solomon

BEMA represents the collision of two streams:
- Academic scholarship recovering Jewish roots (Neusner and others)
- Grassroots fundamentalism's love for Scripture and Jesus

Both are needed. Neither is sufficient alone. Together, they offer hope for recovery.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Jacob Neusner's work in the 1970s reopened dialogue between Jewish and Christian scholars after 1,800 years. Why is academic scholarship important for healing? What can be learned in universities that can't be learned in churches alone?

2. We are "the first generation in 1,800 years for whom healing is actually possible." What makes our generation different? What opportunities do we have that previous generations did not?

3. How should recovering the Jewish roots of Christianity change how we read the New Testament? What would it mean to read Paul or Jesus with Jewish teachers again?

4. If we lost Text, Community, Discipleship, and Wrestling when we lost our Jewish teachers, what would it look like to recover these? What would a church grounded in Jewish roots look like today?

## Part 8: This Is the Story We Find Ourselves In

### Where We Stand
We are the first generation in 1,800 years for whom healing is actually possible.

**The Wound:**
- AD 114-120: The betrayal and schism
- 2nd-19th centuries: Pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, expulsions
- 1933-1945: The Holocaust
- 1,800 years of violence rooted in theology

**The Beginning of Healing:**
- 1965: Nostra Aetate and repudiation of supersessionism
- 1970s: Jewish-Christian academic dialogue begins
- Present: Recovery of Jewish roots in Christian scholarship

### The Invitation
We inherit this history. We did not create these wounds, but we live in their aftermath.

**We Cannot:**
- Erase what happened
- Pretend it wasn't that bad
- Blame it all on "those Christians back then"
- Disconnect theology from its consequences

**We Can:**
- Learn the true history
- Repent of corporate sin
- Recover what was lost
- Build relationships with Jewish neighbors
- Read Scripture through Jewish eyes again
- Resist anti-Semitism in all its forms
- Participate in healing

### The Systematic Theology Connection
This history is not just background for theology. It IS theology.

**When we "deconstruct systematic theology," we must ask:**
- Which systems were built without Jewish input?
- Which doctrines absorbed Gnostic assumptions?
- Which formulas require Greek philosophical training?
- Which teachings contributed to violence?
- What did we lose when we lost our Jewish teachers?
- What would recovery look like?

**This is the story we find ourselves in:**
- Born into a church already separated from its Jewish roots for 1,900 years
- Inheriting theological systems forged in that separation
- Living in the first generation where reconnection is possible
- Invited to participate in recovery and healing

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The course ahead is "Deconstructing Systematic Theology." Having now seen how systematic theology developed (separated from Jewish roots, using Greek categories, shaped by Gnostic assumptions, implicated in violence), what questions do you want to bring to that deconstruction?

2. Is there hope? Can we rebuild theology on a different foundation—one that includes Jewish voices, rejects Gnostic dualisms, prioritizes orthopraxy alongside orthodoxy, and resists the violence of forced conformity? What would that theology look like?

---

## Closing Reflection

We have covered a heavy history. Pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, Holocaust—this is not easy material. It may challenge everything you thought you knew about Christian history.

**But there is hope.**

The door that was slammed shut in AD 114-120 is beginning to open again. Jewish and Christian scholars are talking. Churches are repenting. The Text is coming alive in its Jewish context. The questions we forgot to ask are being asked again.

We did not create these wounds. But we can participate in healing them.

We did not build these theological systems. But we can question, critique, and reconstruct them.

We did not lose our Jewish teachers. But we can learn from their descendants, recover what was lost, and become students again.

**This is the story we find ourselves in.**

Not as perpetrators of ancient crimes, but as inheritors of their legacy. Not as defendants required to justify the past, but as participants invited to shape the future.

The work of recovery has begun. The question is: Will we join it?
