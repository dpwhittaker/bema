# Week 3: Long-Term Consequences and the Glimmer of Hope

## Opening Question
Can the church repent of corporate sin? What does it mean to take responsibility for atrocities committed by Christians centuries ago? And is there hope for healing a wound 1,800 years in the making?

---

## Part 1: The Theological Foundation for Violence

### The Logic of Christian Anti-Semitism
Remember the pattern from Weeks 1 and 2:
1. Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish family (AD 114-120)
2. To justify the betrayal, they made Jews the villains
3. Without Jewish teachers, Gnostic ideas filled the vacuum
4. Councils formulated doctrine using Greek categories, without Jewish input
5. The "Christ-killer" narrative hardened into Christian teaching

**The Medieval Theological Framework:**
- Jews rejected Jesus and had him crucified
- God rejected the Jews and replaced them with the church (**supersessionism**)
- The destruction of the Temple (AD 70) was divine punishment
- Jewish suffering was just punishment for deicide (killing God)
- Converting Jews was a mercy; persecuting them was righteous judgment

**The Forgotten Reality:**
All of this conveniently forgot that Jesus was Jewish, all the apostles were Jewish, the first church was entirely Jewish, Gentiles were grafted in (not substituted), and Jesus himself prayed from the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34).

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Supersessionism taught that God rejected the Jews and replaced them with the church. Romans 9-11 explicitly denies this: "God has not rejected his people" (Romans 11:2). How did the church teach supersessionism for 1,800 years despite Paul's clear rejection of it?

2. The text argues that bad theology leads to violence. Can you draw a line from the creeds (Week 2) to the Crusades and Holocaust?

---

## Part 2: Pogroms and Forced Conversions

### Medieval Jewish Life
Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews in Christian Europe faced:
- Forced segregation into ghettos
- Restrictions on professions (could not own land, join guilds)
- Forced to wear identifying badges or hats
- Blamed for plagues, droughts, and disasters

### The Blood Libel
A vicious lie emerged: Jews kidnapped Christian children to use their blood in Passover rituals. This had no basis in reality (Jewish law strictly forbids consuming blood), but it provided excuse for massacre after massacre.

### Forced Conversions
Jews faced a choice:
- **Convert** to Christianity (become a *converso* or *marrano*)
- **Leave** their homes, businesses, and communities
- **Die** in pogroms

Many chose conversion to save their families. But even *conversos* were never fully trusted—the Inquisition would later target them specifically, suspecting them of secretly practicing Judaism.

**The Theological Irony:**
Christianity teaches that faith cannot be coerced, that genuine conversion requires free choice. Yet the church forced conversions through violence and threat, then punished those whose conversions were deemed insufficiently sincere.

---

## Part 3: The Crusades (1095-1291)

### The Call and the Corruption

**The Original Context:**
- Byzantine Emperor Alexios I requested defensive military aid
- Seljuk Turks had conquered Anatolia
- Christians and Jews under Muslim rule faced persecution
- Pope Urban II responded with multiple motivations: defensive aid, protect persecuted communities, perhaps mend the East-West Schism (1054)

**Where It Went Wrong:**
The Crusades might have remained a justified defensive war if they had limited scope to defending Byzantine territory. But that's not what happened.

### The Rhineland Massacres (1096)
Before the First Crusade even reached Jerusalem, crusaders turned on Jews in Europe.

The logic: "Why travel thousands of miles to fight the infidel when there are infidels right here? Let's kill the Christ-killers before we leave."

**The Massacres:**
- Worms, Germany: 800 Jews murdered
- Mainz, Germany: Over 1,000 Jews killed
- Many other towns across the Rhineland
- Jews offered the choice: convert or die
- Many chose mass suicide rather than forced baptism

### Jerusalem 1099
When crusaders captured Jerusalem, they slaughtered everyone:
- Muslims killed in the streets
- Jews burned alive in their synagogue
- Eastern Christians killed because they looked like Muslims
- Blood reportedly flowed ankle-deep

The crusaders then attended Mass to thank God for their victory.

### The Byzantine Betrayal
The Fourth Crusade (1204) never reached Jerusalem. Instead:
- Crusaders sacked Constantinople—the Christian capital they were supposed to defend
- Looted churches, including Hagia Sophia
- Murdered Eastern Orthodox Christians
- Shattered any hope of East-West reconciliation

**Different Communities, Different Memories:**
- **Jews** remember the Crusades as massacres and forced conversions
- **Muslims** remember them as Western Christian invasion
- **Byzantine Christians** remember them as betrayal
- **Modern Western Christians** often blame them on "the Catholics"—missing that the theological framework (holy war, forced conversion, dehumanization) persisted in Protestant colonialism and conquest

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The First Crusade began with legitimate defensive justification but became horrific. How do justified defensive actions become unjustified atrocities? Where do we see this pattern today?

2. Different communities remember the Crusades differently. How does blaming them entirely on Catholics prevent corporate repentance and miss patterns in Protestant history?

---

## Part 4: The Inquisition (1231-1834)

### Enforcing Orthodoxy
The Medieval Inquisition was established to root out heresy. The Spanish Inquisition (1478-1834) particularly targeted *conversos*—Jews who had converted to Christianity, often under duress.

**The Impossibility:**
If you refused to convert, you were killed for being Jewish. If you converted, you were suspected of being secretly Jewish and investigated by the Inquisition. There was no safe path.

### The Spanish Expulsion (1492)
Ferdinand and Isabella issued the Alhambra Decree:
- All Jews must convert to Christianity or leave Spain
- They had four months to decide
- They could not take gold or silver with them
- An estimated 100,000-200,000 Jews fled

**The Lesson Ignored:**
When you expel the people you've oppressed, you don't just lose their contributions—you lose the chance to repent, to make amends, to heal. Spain chose purity over justice, and everyone suffered.

## Part 5: The Protestant Reformation (1517-1648) — The Pattern Repeats

### The Promise of Reform
In 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, launching the Protestant Reformation. The promise:
- Return to Scripture (*sola scriptura*)
- Salvation by faith alone (*sola fide*)
- Priesthood of all believers
- Freedom from corrupt papal authority
- Access to the Bible in the people's language

**The Question:** Did the Reformation actually return to biblical theology? Or did it perpetuate the same patterns established at Nicaea—just with different philosophical assumptions, new imperial backing, and exponentially more fragmentation?

### The Three Threads Persist

**Thread 1: Philosophy Shifts (But Doesn't Disappear)**
- The Reformation didn't abandon Greek philosophy—it exchanged one philosophical system for another
- **Late Medieval Nominalism** (via William of Ockham) replaced Aristotelian/Thomistic synthesis
- **The Shift:** From "What is God's essence?" to "What is God's will?"
- This sounds more biblical—but it's still a philosophical lens, not a return to Hebrew categories

**Thread 2: Anti-Semitism Intensifies**
- The Reformers perpetuated and amplified Christian anti-Semitism
- Martin Luther's trajectory is particularly horrifying:
  - Early career: Hoped Jews would convert once the gospel was preached purely
  - When they didn't convert: Turned viciously anti-Semitic
  - 1543: Published *On the Jews and Their Lies*

**Martin Luther's "On the Jews and Their Lies" (1543):**
> "First, their synagogues should be set on fire... Secondly, their homes should likewise be broken down and destroyed... Thirdly, they should be deprived of their prayer books and Talmuds... Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death to teach anymore..."

**The Nazis quoted Luther.** They built on Christian anti-Semitism.

**Thread 3: Empire (New Form, Same Function)**
- The Reformation coincided with the Age of Exploration and colonial expansion
- **Spanish/Portuguese Empires:** Catholic; used Inquisition to enforce orthodoxy in colonies
- **British Empire:** Protestant (Anglican); colonialism became the vehicle for spreading "civilization" and Christianity
- **Dutch Empire:** Reformed (Calvinist); commercial colonialism with religious justification
- The pattern: Empire still shapes theology, only now multiple empires back competing theological systems

### The Reformers and Their Ideas

#### Martin Luther (1483-1546)

**What Was Recovered:**
- Scripture in the people's language ✓
- Justification by faith (not purchased through indulgences) ✓
- Direct access to God without priestly mediation ✓

**Philosophical Influences:**
- Deeply influenced by **Nominalism** (especially via Gabriel Biel)
- Focus shifted from God's essence to God's will and power
- Emphasized God's sovereignty and human inability (total depravity)
- Predestination: God's will determines who is saved

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Partially. *Sola scriptura* and justification by faith are biblically grounded.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Yes. Still debating predestination, free will, and God's sovereignty using philosophical categories.
- **Anti-Semitism:** Not only perpetuated but amplified. Luther's recommendations were implemented by the Nazis 400 years later.

#### John Calvin (1509-1564)

**Key Ideas:**
- **TULIP** (Five Points of Calvinism): Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of the saints
- God's absolute sovereignty over all things
- Covenant theology — God relates to humanity through covenants

**The Tragic Irony:**
Calvin argued against Catholic use of force to enforce doctrine, but then:
- Established a theocracy in Geneva with strict moral enforcement
- Supported execution of heretics (including Michael Servetus, burned at stake in 1553 for denying the Trinity)

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Mixed. Covenant theology recovers some biblical categories. But TULIP debates use philosophical logic more than biblical narrative.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Yes. Predestination and election debated using Aristotelian logic and Augustinian metaphysics.

#### The Radical Reformation (Anabaptists)

**Key Ideas:**
- Believer's baptism (not infant baptism)
- Separation of church and state
- Pacifism and refusal to swear oaths
- Simple living and community of goods

**The Cost:**
Anabaptists were persecuted by both Catholics AND Protestants:
- Drowned (ironic "rebaptism") by Protestant authorities
- Burned by Catholic authorities
- Thousands martyred

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Arguably closest to Jesus's teachings among Reformation movements. Emphasis on discipleship, simplicity, non-violence, and community reflects Sermon on the Mount.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Least philosophical of all Reformation movements. Focused on practical obedience.

**The Irony:**
The group that most closely followed Jesus's teachings (enemy love, non-violence, simplicity) was killed by both Catholic and Protestant Christians. The Jerusalem Standard—"no further burden"—was violated by those who claimed to be reforming the church.

### The Fragmentation Accelerates

**The Protestant Pattern:**
- Decentralized authority: *sola scriptura* + priesthood of believers
- Every believer can interpret Scripture
- Result: Exponential fragmentation

**The Sad Math:**
- Catholic and Orthodox: 2 main communions (plus Oriental Orthodox = 3)
- Protestant denominations today: **45,000+** (World Christian Encyclopedia)

**What Happened?**
Once you establish that unity requires perfect doctrinal agreement, and you give every believer authority to interpret Scripture, fragmentation is inevitable. Every theological dispute becomes grounds for split.

The Jerusalem Council said "no further burden." The Reformation said "these doctrines are essential." Then each group defined "essential" differently.

### The Colonialism Connection (Thread 3: The New Empire)

The Reformation coincided with European colonial expansion. Watch how Thread 3 (empire) operates:

**Spanish and Portuguese Empires (Catholic):**
- 1492: Columbus sails; Spanish Inquisition expels Jews
- Colonial conquest justified as spreading Christianity
- Forced conversion of indigenous peoples

**British Empire (Protestant/Anglican):**
- Colonial expansion justified as spreading "civilization" and the gospel
- Transatlantic slave trade justified biblically (Ham's curse, Philemon reinterpreted)
- Residential schools (continuing into 20th century) forcibly removed children from families

**Dutch Empire (Reformed/Calvinist):**
- Dutch East India Company spread Calvinism alongside trade
- South African apartheid later justified using Reformed theology

**The Pattern:**
Empire still shapes theology. The difference: now multiple empires back competing Christian traditions. And all perpetuate:
- Supersessionism (Christians replace Jews)
- Colonialism (Europeans "save" non-Europeans)
- Slavery (Africans are cursed, or slavery is biblically permissible)
- Forced conversion (heretics, Jews, indigenous peoples)

### Did the Reformation Return to Biblical Theology?

**What Was Recovered:**
- Scripture in the people's language ✓
- Direct access to God without priestly mediation ✓
- Justification by faith (not purchased through indulgences) ✓
- Emphasis on God's grace ✓

**What Was NOT Recovered:**
- ✗ Still debating theology using Greek philosophical categories
- ✗ Still supersessionist (church replaces Israel)
- ✗ Still using force to enforce orthodoxy
- ✗ Still prioritizing orthodoxy over orthopraxy
- ✗ Anti-Semitism intensified (Luther)
- ✗ Created exponentially more divisions
- ✗ Partnered with empire (colonialism)

**What Was Made Worse:**
- Fragmentation: From 2-3 main communions to 45,000+ denominations
- Justification for slavery and colonialism (new philosophical/theological frameworks)
- Anti-Semitism: Luther's writings gave theological cover to genocide

### The Jerusalem Standard—Still Ignored

Imagine if the Reformers had followed the Jerusalem Council:

**Instead of:**
"We will create detailed systematic theologies. Those who disagree are heretics. We'll establish competing churches."

**They could have said:**
"We all confess Jesus as Lord. We disagree about predestination, baptism methods, church governance. It seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden. Let's stay in communion while we work through these questions."

**The Result:**
- Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox might have remained in dialogue
- Diversity of worship and theology within one body
- No need for 45,000 denominations
- Fellowship based on Jesus, not perfect doctrinal agreement

But that's not what happened. The Reformation repeated the pattern of Nicaea: philosophical precision, forced uniformity (within each tradition), and division enforced by power.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Martin Luther recovered biblical truths (justification by faith, Scripture in vernacular) but wrote viciously anti-Semitic material that the Nazis quoted. Can we honor his contributions while condemning his anti-Semitism? Or is his legacy permanently tainted?

2. The Anabaptists came closest to Jesus's teachings (non-violence, discipleship, simplicity) and were killed by both Catholics and Protestants. What does this reveal about whose Christianity is considered "orthodox"? Does orthodoxy correlate with power?

3. Today there are 45,000+ Protestant denominations. Is fragmentation an acceptable price for doctrinal clarity? Or did something go wrong?

4. The Reformation coincided with colonialism, and Reformed theology was used to justify slavery, apartheid, and forced conversion. How did Christians justify these things while following Jesus?

## Part 6: The Holocaust (1933-1945)

### The Culmination of Christian Anti-Semitism
The Holocaust was not a departure from Christian history. It was its horrifying culmination.

**Hitler's Innovations:**
- Industrial-scale murder (gas chambers, death camps)
- Bureaucratic efficiency (railroad logistics, record-keeping)
- Scientific racism (eugenics, racial hygiene)

**But the Foundation Was Already Laid:**
- 1,800 years of Christian teaching that Jews were Christ-killers
- Centuries of sermons blaming Jews for every evil
- Theological supersessionism that said God had rejected the Jews
- A pattern of dehumanization that made genocide thinkable

**The Nazis quoted Luther.** They built on Christian anti-Semitism. They implemented what Christian theology had been teaching for centuries.

### Six Million
- Six million Jews murdered
- 1.5 million children
- Entire communities erased
- A wound beyond words

**The Question That Will Not Go Away:**
How could the Holocaust happen in Christian Europe? How could the people who sang "Jesus loves the little children" murder 1.5 million Jewish children?

The answer: because Christian theology had taught for 1,800 years that Jews were cursed, rejected, deserving of suffering. The Holocaust did not come out of nowhere. It came out of us.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The text argues that the Holocaust was the culmination of 1,800 years of Christian anti-Semitism, not a departure from it. Do you agree? How much responsibility does Christian theology bear for the Holocaust?

2. Martin Luther wrote viciously anti-Semitic material in 1543. The Nazis quoted him. Should Protestants reckon with Luther's legacy differently?

---

## Part 7: The Glimmer of Hope

### Confronting the Horror
After World War II, Christians could no longer avoid the question: What role did our theology play in the Holocaust?

Some refused to ask. They blamed Hitler, blamed Germany, blamed everything except the anti-Semitism embedded in Christian teaching.

But others looked honestly at the history and were horrified by what they saw.

### Vatican II and Nostra Aetate (1965)

**The Catholic Church's Response:**
In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued *Nostra Aetate* (In Our Time), declaring:

1. The Jewish people are not collectively responsible for Jesus's death
2. Jews are not rejected or cursed by God
3. The church decries hatred and persecution of Jews
4. Anti-Semitism is condemned

**What It Meant:**
- The "Christ-killer" charge is false
- Jews are still in covenant with God
- Christians must oppose anti-Semitism
- Dialogue and reconciliation are possible

**For the first time in 1,800 years, the Catholic Church officially repudiated supersessionism and theological anti-Semitism.**

### Protestant Responses
Protestant denominations issued similar statements:
- Presbyterian Church (USA) repudiated supersessionism
- Evangelical Lutheran Church in America renounced Luther's anti-Semitic writings
- United Methodist Church affirmed God's covenant with the Jewish people

**The Common Thread:**
After the Holocaust, churches began to acknowledge that Christian theology had contributed to Jewish suffering. They began to repent.

### Jacob Neusner and the Academic Revolution (1970s)

**Jacob Neusner** (1932-2016):
- Jewish literary scholar with Orthodox roots
- Brought Christian scholars to the table with Jewish scholars
- Opened a dialogue that had been closed for 1,800 years

**The Breakthrough:**
Academic Christians began learning from Jewish scholars:
- How to read the Hebrew Bible in its original context
- The Jewishness of Jesus and Paul
- Rabbinic methods of interpretation
- The richness of Second Temple Judaism

**The Rediscovery:**
> "We never repaired that schism for 1,800 years. We went down our own stream of thought, our own stream of consciousness. We had councils and reformations and great movements, but they were all very Gentile. Now, 1,800 years later, these two worlds collide again, this Jewish and Gentile world, on a scholastic level, on an academic level in the world of scholarship." —Marty Solomon, BEMA Podcast

### The Recovery Begins
Modern scholarship recovering Jewish roots of Christianity:
- **E.P. Sanders**: *Paul and Palestinian Judaism* (1977)
- **N.T. Wright**: Kingdom theology rooted in Second Temple Judaism
- **Amy-Jill Levine**: Jewish perspectives on Jesus and the New Testament
- Countless others

**What's Being Recovered:**
- The Jewishness of Jesus's teachings
- Paul's thoroughly Jewish theology
- The cultural context of the Gospels
- The continuity between Old and New Testaments
- The Hebrew worldview underlying Christian Scripture

**The BEMA Podcast:**
> "BEMA is not just indebted—this whole discussion would not happen without the work of Jacob Neusner, period." —Marty Solomon

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Vatican II's *Nostra Aetate* (1965) officially repudiated the "Christ-killer" charge and supersessionism. Why did it take until 1965? What changed after the Holocaust that made this possible?

2. Jacob Neusner's work in the 1970s reopened dialogue between Jewish and Christian scholars after 1,800 years. Why is academic scholarship important for healing?

3. We are "the first generation in 1,800 years for whom healing is actually possible." What makes our generation different?

---

## Part 8: This Is the Story We Find Ourselves In

### Where We Stand
We are the first generation in 1,800 years for whom healing is actually possible.

**The Wound:**
- AD 114-120: The betrayal and schism
- 2nd-16th centuries: Pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, expulsions
- 1517-1648: Protestant Reformation (fragmentation accelerates, anti-Semitism persists)
- 1492-1900s: Colonial expansion and forced conversion
- 1933-1945: The Holocaust
- 1,800 years of violence rooted in theology

**The Beginning of Healing:**
- 1965: Nostra Aetate and repudiation of supersessionism
- 1970s: Jewish-Christian academic dialogue begins
- Present: Recovery of Jewish roots in Christian scholarship

### The Invitation
We inherit this history. We did not create these wounds, but we live in their aftermath.

**We Cannot:**
- Erase what happened
- Pretend it wasn't that bad
- Blame it all on "those Christians back then"
- Disconnect theology from its consequences

**We Can:**
- Learn the true history
- Repent of corporate sin
- Recover what was lost
- Build relationships with Jewish neighbors
- Read Scripture through Jewish eyes again
- Resist anti-Semitism in all its forms
- Participate in healing

### The Systematic Theology Connection
This history is not just background for theology. It IS theology.

**When we "deconstruct systematic theology," we must ask:**
- Which systems were built without Jewish input?
- Which doctrines absorbed Gnostic assumptions?
- Which formulas require Greek philosophical training?
- Which teachings contributed to violence?
- What did we lose when we lost our Jewish teachers?
- What would recovery look like?

**This is the story we find ourselves in:**
- Born into a church already separated from its Jewish roots for 1,900 years
- Inheriting theological systems forged in that separation
- Living in the first generation where reconnection is possible
- Invited to participate in recovery and healing

### **FINAL DISCUSSION**

1. Having now seen how systematic theology developed (separated from Jewish roots, using Greek categories, shaped by Gnostic assumptions, implicated in violence), what questions do you want to bring to that deconstruction?

2. Is there hope? Can we rebuild theology on a different foundation—one that includes Jewish voices, rejects Gnostic dualisms, prioritizes orthopraxy alongside orthodoxy, and resists the violence of forced conformity?

---

## Closing Reflection

We have covered a heavy history. Pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, Reformation, Holocaust—this is not easy material.

**But there is hope.**

The door that was slammed shut in AD 114-120 is beginning to open again. Jewish and Christian scholars are talking. Churches are repenting. The Text is coming alive in its Jewish context. The questions we forgot to ask are being asked again.

We did not create these wounds. But we can participate in healing them.

We did not build these theological systems. But we can question, critique, and reconstruct them.

We did not lose our Jewish teachers. But we can learn from their descendants, recover what was lost, and become students again.

**This is the story we find ourselves in.**

Not as perpetrators of ancient crimes, but as inheritors of their legacy. Not as defendants required to justify the past, but as participants invited to shape the future.

The work of recovery has begun. The question is: Will we join it?
