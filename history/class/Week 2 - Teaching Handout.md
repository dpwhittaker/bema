# Week 2: Creeds, Councils, and Continuing Schisms

## The Jerusalem Standard (AD 49)

**The Crisis:** Must Gentiles become Jews to follow Jesus?

**The Method:**
- Peter: "God gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us"
- James: "We should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God"
- The Letter: "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you **no further burden**"

**The Jerusalem Standard:**
- **Language**: Hebrew/Aramaic thought, Scripture
- **Method**: Story, Scripture, experience of the Spirit
- **Goal**: MINIMUM requirements for fellowship
- **Test**: Practical (avoid idolatry, sexual immorality)
- **Result**: Unity in diversity—Jews and Gentiles worship together

## The Three Threads

### Thread 1: Greek Philosophy
- **2nd-3rd centuries**: Without Jewish teachers, Greek philosophy becomes default
- **Key categories**: Substance (*ousia*), essence, being, nature (*physis*), hypostasis
- **The problem**: These categories are FOREIGN to Scripture
  - Bible asks: "Who is Jesus and what has he done?"
  - Creeds ask: "What is Jesus's metaphysical composition?"

### Thread 2: Anti-Semitism (*Adversus Judaeos*)
**Early architects (BEFORE Constantine):**
- **Epistle of Barnabas** (c. 130): "Their covenant was broken... ours was sealed"
- **Justin Martyr** (100-165): Jewish suffering = divine punishment for rejecting Christ
- **Melito of Sardis** (d. 180): **First clear deicide charge**: "God has been murdered by an Israelite hand"
- **Tertullian** (155-220): Jews permanently rejected by God

**Pattern:**
1. Lose Jewish teachers (AD 114-120)
2. Delegitimize Jewish interpretation
3. Claim exclusive Christian interpretation
4. Blame Jews for deicide
5. Argue for permanent divine rejection

### Thread 3: Imperial Power
**Constantine's role:**
- **Convened Council of Nicaea** (AD 325)
- Personally attended and presided
- Bishops who disagreed risked **imperial exile**
- Letter to bishops: Separate from "the **detestable company of the Jews**"

**Every major council:**
- Nicaea (325): **Constantine** convened
- Constantinople (381): **Theodosius I** convened
- Ephesus (431): **Theodosius II** convened
- Chalcedon (451): **Marcian** convened

**Compare:**
- Jerusalem: "It seemed good to the **Holy Spirit** and to us"
- Nicaea: "It seemed good to the **Emperor** and to us who want to stay in his good graces"

## The Councils

### Nicaea (AD 325): Arius vs. Athanasius
**The irony:**
- **Both used Greek philosophy** (not Hebrew categories)
- Arius: Neoplatonic hierarchy (Jesus = highest created being)
- Athanasius: Stoic/Aristotelian substance metaphysics (Jesus = *homoousios* with Father)

**What determined "orthodoxy":**
- NOT Scripture vs. heresy
- NOT even Greek philosophy A vs. B
- **Which Greek philosophy could avoid being labeled "Jewish" while pleasing the Emperor**

**The weapon:** Athanasius labeled Arius a "**Judaizer**"
- In Constantine's anti-Semitic context, this was politically devastating
- Arius exiled by imperial decree
- Arian Christianity eventually eliminated

### Constantinople (381): The Holy Spirit
- **Theodosius I** convened
- **Western bishops excluded** (Eastern-only council)
- Added: Spirit "proceeds from the Father"
- **Later problem**: West unilaterally added "**and the Son**" (*filioque*) → Great Schism 1054

### Ephesus (431): *Theotokos*
- **Theodosius II** convened
- Political manipulation: Cyril started council before opponents arrived
- Nestorius condemned and exiled
- **Church of the East** separated (still separated 1,600 years later)

### Chalcedon (451): Two Natures
- **Marcian** convened
- 500+ bishops; those who refused to sign faced exile
- Oriental Orthodox rejected the formula
- **60 million** separated for 1,500 years over **vocabulary**
  - 1990: Theologians conclude they "believe the same thing in different Greek words"

## The Nicene Creed (Key Excerpt)

> We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
>
> And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only **[*monogenēs*]** Son of God, **begotten** **[*gennēthenta*]** of the Father before all ages, **Light from Light**, true God from true God, **begotten not made**, **of one Being [*homoousios*]** with the Father; through him all things were made...
>
> And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who **proceeds from** the Father [**and the Son**], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets...

## The Chalcedonian Definition (Key Excerpt)

> ...one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, acknowledged in **two natures** **[*physesin*]** which undergo **no confusion, no change, no separation, no division**; at no point was the difference between the **natures** **[*physeōn*]** taken away through the union, but rather the property of both **natures** **[*physeōs*]** is preserved and comes together into a single **person** **[*prosōpon*]** and a single **subsistent being** **[*hypostasin*]**...

### Greek Philosophical Terms NOT Found in Scripture:

| Term | Greek | Origin |
|------|-------|--------|
| ***homoousios*** | ὁμοούσιος | Aristotelian metaphysics: "of the same substance/essence." Previously used by **Gnostics**. |
| ***ousia*** | οὐσία | Aristotle's *Metaphysics*: "substance, essence, being." Bible never asks "what is God made of?" |
| **"Light from Light"** | φῶς ἐκ φωτός | **Neoplatonic** emanation imagery (Plotinus) |
| **"proceeds from"** | ἐκπορεύεται | **Neoplatonic** emanation vocabulary (Plotinus). Scripture says "sent" or "poured out." |
| ***hypostasis*** | ὑπόστασις | Platonic/Stoic: "subsistence, person, underlying reality" |
| ***physis*** (nature) | φύσις | Aristotle: "what makes something the kind of thing it is." Used 14 times. Bible never discusses Jesus's "natures." |
| **The Four Negatives** | ἀσυγχύτως, ἀτρέπτως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀχωρίστως | **Apophatic theology** (negative definition)—a Greek philosophical method. Hebrew thought defines by story and action, not by negation. |

**What Scripture Says:**
- "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14)
- "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Cor 5:19)
- "He is the image of the invisible God" (Col 1:15)

## The Pattern: Division After Division

| Date | Event | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| **AD 49** | **Jerusalem Council** | Jews and Gentiles worship together |
| **AD 325** | **Nicaea** | Arian churches eliminated |
| **AD 431** | **Ephesus** | Church of the East separated (500,000 today) |
| **AD 451** | **Chalcedon** | Oriental Orthodox separated (60 million today) |
| **AD 1054** | **Great Schism** | Catholic-Orthodox split (1.5 billion separated) |

**The Jerusalem Council preserved unity. Every subsequent council created division.**

## Abandoning the Jerusalem Standard

| Jerusalem Council | Later Councils |
|------------------|----------------|
| "No further burden" | Maximum precision required |
| Practical tests (avoid idolatry) | Intellectual tests (affirm *homoousios*) |
| Unity in diversity | Uniformity demanded |
| Spirit-led consensus | Imperial enforcement (exile) |
| "How can we worship together?" | "What is the precise metaphysical definition?" |
| Church stayed together | Church fractured permanently |

## The Foundation Is Flawed

Our systematic theology is built on:
1. **Greek philosophy** (substance, essence, being)
2. Articulated in an **anti-Semitic context** (rejection of Jewish interpretation)
3. Enforced by **imperial power** (not spiritual discernment)

**Result:**
- Creeds requiring philosophical education
- Divisions over one Greek letter (*homoousios* vs. *homoiousios*)
- Permanent schisms over vocabulary
- "Orthodoxy" determined by pleasing the Emperor and avoiding Jewish association
- Christianity that looks more like **Plato under Constantine** than **Moses with Jesus**

## Discussion Questions

1. **Constantine convened Nicaea** and could exile dissenters. Can we claim "it seemed good to the Holy Spirit" under threat of imperial exile?

2. **Both Arius and Athanasius used Greek philosophy**, but Athanasius won by labeling Arius a "Judaizer." How did anti-Semitism function as a weapon in theological debate?

3. After 1,500 years, theologians discovered Chalcedonian and Oriental Orthodox Christians "**believe the same thing in different words.**" 60 million people separated for fifteen centuries over **vocabulary**. What does this reveal?

4. The three threads worked together: anti-Semitism removed Jewish teachers, Greek philosophy filled the vacuum, imperial power enforced the result. How might Christianity be different if we had kept Jewish teachers and Hebrew categories?

5. Our systematic theology is described as having a "**flawed foundation**" (Greek metaphysics + anti-Semitism + imperial power). Is this too strong? Or do we need to deconstruct and rebuild?

## For Next Week

Next week: The long-term consequences—Crusades, Inquisition, Holocaust. How theological anti-Semitism, rooted in AD 114-120 and reinforced by centuries of *Adversus Judaeos* teaching, led to unimaginable violence.

But also hope: How the Holocaust finally forced the church to confront its anti-Semitism, leading to *Nostra Aetate* (1965) and the beginning of Jewish-Christian dialogue.
