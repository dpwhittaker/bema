# Week 3: Long-Term Consequences and the Glimmer of Hope

## Church History as Preface to Deconstructing Systematic Theology

### Opening Question
Can the church repent of corporate sin? What does it mean to take responsibility for atrocities committed by Christians centuries ago? And is there hope for healing a wound 1,800 years in the making?

---

## Part 1: From Theology to Violence

### The Logic of Christian Anti-Semitism
Remember the pattern from Weeks 1 and 2:
1. Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish family (AD 114-120)
2. To justify the betrayal, they had to make Jews the villains
3. Without Jewish teachers, Gnostic ideas filled the vacuum
4. Councils formulated doctrine using Greek categories, without Jewish input
5. The "Christ-killer" narrative hardened into Christian teaching
6. Jews were blamed for rejecting and murdering their own Messiah

**The Theological Foundation:**
By the medieval period, Christian theology taught:
- Jews rejected Jesus and had him crucified
- God rejected the Jews and replaced them with the church (**supersessionism**)
- The destruction of the Temple (AD 70) was divine punishment
- Jewish suffering was just punishment for deicide (killing God)
- Jews were in spiritual blindness, worshiping the devil
- Converting Jews was a mercy; persecuting them was righteous judgment

**The Forgotten Reality:**
All of this conveniently forgot that:
- Jesus was Jewish
- All the apostles were Jewish
- The first church was entirely Jewish
- Gentiles were grafted in, not substituted
- Jesus himself prayed from the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34)

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Supersessionism taught that God rejected the Jews and replaced them with the church. Romans 9-11 explicitly denies this: "God has not rejected his people" (Romans 11:2). How did the church teach supersessionism for 1,800 years despite Paul's clear rejection of it?

2. The text argues that bad theology leads to violence. Can you draw a line from the creeds (Week 2) to the Crusades and Holocaust? How does theology shape practice?

3. We've traced a pattern: betrayal → loss of Jewish context → Gnostic infiltration → councils without Jewish input → creeds in Greek categories → schisms over those creeds → violence justified by theology. If this pattern is accurate, what does it mean for systematic theology as we've inherited it?

## Part 2: Pogroms and Forced Conversions

### Medieval Jewish Life
Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews in Christian Europe faced:
- Forced segregation into ghettos
- Restrictions on professions (could not own land, join guilds)
- Forced to wear identifying badges or hats
- Subjected to special taxes
- Forbidden to testify against Christians in court
- Blamed for plagues, droughts, and disasters

### The Blood Libel
A particularly vicious lie emerged: Jews kidnapped Christian children to use their blood in Passover rituals. This "blood libel" had no basis in reality (Jewish law strictly forbids consuming blood), but it provided excuse for massacre after massacre.

**The Pattern:**
1. A child goes missing or dies
2. Jews are accused of ritual murder
3. Mob violence erupts
4. Jewish communities are destroyed
5. Survivors are expelled or forced to convert
6. Church authorities sometimes condemned the violence after the fact
7. The pattern repeats in the next town

### Forced Conversions
Jews faced a choice:
- **Convert** to Christianity (become a *converso* or *marrano*)
- **Leave** their homes, businesses, and communities
- **Die** in pogroms

Many chose conversion to save their families. But even *conversos* were never fully trusted—the Inquisition would later target them specifically, suspecting them of secretly practicing Judaism.

**The Theological Irony:**
Christianity teaches that faith cannot be coerced, that genuine conversion requires free choice. Yet the church forced conversions through violence and threat, then punished those whose conversions were deemed insufficiently sincere.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Before this class, how much did you know about Christian persecution of Jews? Why do you think this history is not commonly taught in churches?

2. The Spanish Inquisition targeted *conversos*—Jews who had converted to Christianity. What does this reveal about the impossibility of Jewish existence in Christian Europe? If you can't win by refusing to convert and can't win by converting, what options are left?

## Part 3: The Crusades (1095-1291)

### The Call for Help and the Hope for Reconciliation

In 1095, Pope Urban II called the First Crusade in response to a desperate plea from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. The context was complex:

**The Byzantine Cry for Help:**
- Muslim Seljuk Turks had conquered most of Anatolia (modern Turkey)
- Byzantine Empire was losing territory rapidly
- Christians and Jews in Muslim-controlled territories faced persecution, forced conversion, and violence
- Pilgrimage routes to Jerusalem were increasingly dangerous
- Emperor Alexios requested military aid from the West

**Pope Urban's Multiple Motivations:**
- Respond to legitimate Byzantine request for defensive aid
- Protect Christian and Jewish communities under Muslim persecution
- Perhaps mend the East-West Schism of 1054 (only 41 years earlier)
- Demonstrate papal authority and unite Christendom
- Offer spiritual benefits to participants

**The Just War Question:**
The situation presented a legitimate case for Just War theory:
- Defensive war to protect persecuted communities ✓
- Legitimate authority (Pope and Byzantine Emperor) ✓
- Last resort after diplomatic failures ✓
- Proportional response to help Byzantine defense ✓

**Where It Went Wrong:**
The Crusades might have remained a justified defensive war if they had:
- Limited scope to defending Byzantine territory
- Protected pilgrims and persecuted minorities
- Respected the Byzantine request (defensive aid, not conquest)
- Avoided targeting non-combatants

But that's not what happened.

### Who Actually Fought

The popular image of peasant-only Crusades is incomplete:

**Feudal Lords Led the Armies:**
- Godfrey of Bouillon (Duke of Lower Lorraine)
- Raymond IV of Toulouse (Count)
- Bohemond of Taranto (Norman prince)
- Robert II of Flanders (Count)
- Many other nobles with their retinues

**The Feudal Context:**
Medieval feudalism was a complex web of:
- Overlapping loyalties and conflicting alliances
- Constant political maneuvering
- Threats from neighbors and rivals in every direction
- Promises and counter-promises creating instability

The Crusades offered relief: a common enemy, a unified purpose, a pause from the exhausting game of feudal politics.

**But the Armies Were Primarily Peasants:**
- Poor peasants who could not afford to buy indulgences
- Promised eternal security through holy war
- Second sons with no inheritance
- Criminals offered pardons
- The desperate seeking relief from debt

**The Spiritual Economy:**
The church had created a system where:
- Sins could be forgiven through purchased indulgences (if you had money)
- Or through pilgrimage (if you had time)
- Or through holy war (if you had nothing else)

For the poor, the Crusades offered what they could never afford: guaranteed salvation through martyrdom in holy war.

### The Rhineland Massacres (1096)
Before the First Crusade even reached Jerusalem, crusaders turned on Jews in Europe.

The logic was simple: "Why travel thousands of miles to fight the infidel when there are infidels right here? Let's kill the Christ-killers before we leave."

**The Massacres:**
- Speyer, Germany: Jewish community attacked
- Worms, Germany: 800 Jews murdered
- Mainz, Germany: Over 1,000 Jews killed
- Cologne, Trier, Metz: More massacres

Some bishops tried to protect Jews. Most did not. In many cases, Jews were offered the same choice as always: convert or die. Many chose mass suicide rather than forced baptism.

**Different Communities, Different Memories:**
- **Jews** remember the Crusades as one of the darkest periods in their history—massacres, forced conversions, entire communities destroyed
- **Muslims** remember the Crusades as Western Christian invasion and the beginning of colonial aggression
- **Byzantine Christians** remember the Crusades as betrayal—the West conquered Constantinople (1204) instead of helping defend it
- **Modern Western Christians** have a complicated relationship:
  - Largely recognize the Crusades as evil and unjustified
  - But often blame them entirely on "the Catholics" (perpetuating Protestant-Catholic division)
  - Miss that the theological framework that justified the Crusades (holy war, forced conversion, dehumanization of non-Christians) wasn't unique to medieval Catholicism—it persisted in Protestant colonialism, slavery justifications, and conquest of indigenous peoples

**Why the Difference in Memory Matters:**
If we remember the Crusades as "something Catholics did" rather than "something Christians did," we:
- Absolve ourselves of responsibility
- Miss the ongoing patterns (colonialism, manifest destiny, "Christian nation" ideology)
- Fail to examine the theological frameworks that made such violence possible
- Perpetuate division rather than corporate repentance

### Jerusalem 1099
When crusaders finally captured Jerusalem, they slaughtered everyone:
- Muslims killed in the streets
- Jews burned alive in their synagogue
- Eastern Christians killed because they looked like Muslims
- Blood reportedly flowed ankle-deep

The crusaders then attended Mass to thank God for their victory.

### The Byzantine Betrayal: From Defensive Alliance to Conquest

If Pope Urban II hoped to mend the East-West Schism through the Crusades, the outcome was the opposite.

**What Emperor Alexios Requested:**
- Military aid to defend Byzantine territory
- Help pushing back Seljuk advances in Anatolia
- Cooperation between East and West

**What He Got:**
- Crusaders who ignored Byzantine strategy
- Western lords who claimed conquered territory for themselves (not returning it to Byzantium)
- Growing mistrust and cultural conflict
- The ultimate betrayal: the Fourth Crusade (1204)

**The Fourth Crusade (1204): The Final Break**
The Fourth Crusade never reached Jerusalem. Instead:
- Crusaders sacked Constantinople—the Christian capital they were supposed to defend
- Looted churches, including Hagia Sophia
- Murdered Eastern Orthodox Christians
- Established a Latin (Catholic) kingdom in Byzantine territory
- Shattered any hope of East-West reconciliation

**The Irony:**
A Crusade called partly to heal the East-West Schism instead made it permanent. Eastern Christians remember 1204 as the ultimate Western betrayal. The wound has never healed.

### Later Crusades
The Crusades continued for two centuries, and the pattern of violence spreading became clear:
- The Fourth Crusade (1204) sacked Constantinople—*fellow Christians*
- The Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229) massacred Cathars in southern France
- The Northern Crusades forced conversion of Baltic pagans

**The Pattern:**
Once you establish that violence in Christ's name is acceptable, once you divide the world into "us" (saved) and "them" (damned), once you make orthodoxy a matter of life and death, the killing spreads. Muslims, Jews, heretics, schismatics—anyone who fails the test.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The First Crusade began with legitimate defensive justification: Byzantine Christians under threat, persecuted minorities needing protection, Just War criteria arguably met. But it became something horrific. How do justified defensive actions become unjustified atrocities? Where do we see this pattern today?

2. The feudal lords welcomed a pause from political maneuvering by uniting against a common enemy. How does identifying an "enemy" create unity? What are the dangers of unity based on common enemies rather than common purpose?

3. The poor were offered eternal security through holy war—something they couldn't afford through indulgences. How did the church's "spiritual economy" create an incentive structure for violence? What incentive structures exist today that might encourage similar outcomes?

4. Different communities remember the Crusades differently: Jews as massacres, Muslims as invasion, Byzantine Christians as betrayal, modern Western Christians as something "Catholics did." How does blaming the Crusades entirely on Catholics perpetuate division and prevent corporate repentance?

5. The theological framework that justified the Crusades (holy war, forced conversion, dehumanization) wasn't unique to medieval Catholicism—it reappeared in Protestant colonialism, slavery, and conquest. If we only blame "those Catholics back then," what patterns do we fail to see in our own traditions?

## Part 4: The Inquisition (1231-1834)

### Enforcing Orthodoxy
The Medieval Inquisition was established to root out heresy in Christian Europe. Later versions included:
- The Spanish Inquisition (1478-1834)
- The Portuguese Inquisition (1536-1821)
- The Roman Inquisition (1542-1860)

**The Method:**
- Accused heretics were investigated
- Torture was used to extract confessions
- Those who recanted might be spared (but lived under suspicion)
- Those who refused to recant were executed, usually by burning
- Property of the condemned was confiscated by church and state

### Targeting Conversos
The Spanish Inquisition particularly targeted *conversos*—Jews who had converted to Christianity, often under duress.

**The Suspicion:**
Even after conversion, even after generations, Christians suspected *conversos* of secretly practicing Judaism. The Inquisition:
- Spied on families to see if they lit Sabbath candles
- Investigated food practices (avoiding pork, keeping kosher)
- Questioned neighbors about observance of Jewish holidays
- Tortured suspects to confess

**The Impossibility:**
If you refused to convert, you were killed for being Jewish. If you converted, you were suspected of being secretly Jewish and investigated by the Inquisition. There was no safe path.

### The Spanish Expulsion (1492)
In 1492—the same year Columbus sailed—Ferdinand and Isabella issued the Alhambra Decree:
- All Jews must convert to Christianity or leave Spain
- They had four months to decide
- They could not take gold or silver with them
- An estimated 100,000-200,000 Jews fled

Many died during the flight. Those who survived became refugees, scattered across Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire.

**The Irony:**
Spain expelled its Jewish population in the name of Catholic purity. Spain's economy suffered terribly as a result, losing skilled workers, merchants, and financiers. Within a generation, Spain's golden age was over.

**The Lesson Ignored:**
When you expel the people you've oppressed, you don't just lose their contributions—you lose the chance to repent, to make amends, to heal. Spain chose purity over justice, and everyone suffered.

## Part 5: The Protestant Reformation (1517-1648) — The Pattern Repeats

### The Promise of Reform
In 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, launching what would become the Protestant Reformation. The promise was compelling:
- Return to Scripture (*sola scriptura*)
- Salvation by faith alone (*sola fide*)
- Priesthood of all believers
- Freedom from corrupt papal authority
- Access to the Bible in the people's language

Finally, it seemed, the church would break free from centuries of corruption and return to biblical faith.

**The Question:** Did the Reformation actually return to biblical theology? Or did it perpetuate the same patterns established at Nicaea—just with different philosophical assumptions, new imperial backing, and exponentially more fragmentation?

### The Three Threads Persist

Look closely, and you'll see the same three threads that shaped the councils:

**Thread 1: Philosophy Shifts (But Doesn't Disappear)**
- The Reformation didn't abandon Greek philosophy—it exchanged one philosophical system for another
- **Late Medieval Nominalism** (via William of Ockham) replaced Aristotelian/Thomistic synthesis
- **The Shift:** From "What is God's essence?" to "What is God's will?"
  - Medieval scholasticism (following Aquinas): We can know God's nature through reason and revelation
  - Nominalism: We cannot know God's essence; we can only know His will as revealed in Scripture and action
  - This sounds more biblical—but it's still a philosophical lens, not a return to Hebrew categories

**Thread 2: Anti-Semitism Intensifies**
- The Reformers perpetuated and amplified Christian anti-Semitism
- Martin Luther's trajectory is particularly horrifying:
  - Early career: Hoped Jews would convert once the gospel was preached purely
  - When they didn't convert: Turned viciously anti-Semitic
  - 1543: Published *On the Jews and Their Lies* (quoted in Week 3, Part 5)
  - Recommended burning synagogues, destroying Jewish homes, confiscating prayer books, forbidding rabbis to teach
  - The Nazis quoted Luther extensively

**Thread 3: Empire (New Form, Same Function)**
- The Reformation coincided with the Age of Exploration and colonial expansion
- **Spanish Empire:** Remained Catholic; used Inquisition to enforce orthodoxy in colonies
- **Portuguese Empire:** Catholic; colonial expansion tied to forced conversion
- **British Empire:** Protestant (Anglican); colonialism became the vehicle for spreading "civilization" and Christianity
- **Dutch Empire:** Reformed (Calvinist); commercial colonialism with religious justification
- The pattern: Empire still shapes theology, only now multiple empires back competing theological systems

### The Reformers and Their Ideas

Let's examine the major Reformation figures and their theological contributions, asking: Did they return to biblical categories, or introduce new philosophical systems?

#### Martin Luther (1483-1546)

**Key Ideas:**
- *Sola scriptura* (Scripture alone) — only the Bible is authoritative, not church tradition
- *Sola fide* (faith alone) — justification by faith, not works
- *Sola gratia* (grace alone) — salvation is by grace, not human merit
- Priesthood of all believers — direct access to God without priestly mediation
- Translated Bible into German — gave people access to Scripture

**Philosophical Influences:**
- Deeply influenced by **Nominalism** (especially Gabriel Biel's interpretation of Ockham)
- Focus shifted from God's essence to God's will and power
- Emphasized God's sovereignty and human inability (total depravity)
- Predestination: God's will determines who is saved (though Luther was less systematic than Calvin on this)

**The Anti-Semitism Problem:**
Luther's *On the Jews and Their Lies* (1543):
> "First, their synagogues should be set on fire... Secondly, their homes should likewise be broken down and destroyed... Thirdly, they should be deprived of their prayer books and Talmuds... Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death to teach anymore..."

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Partially. *Sola scriptura* and justification by faith are biblically grounded. Access to Scripture in vernacular languages was transformative.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Yes. Still debating predestination, free will, and God's sovereignty using philosophical categories.
- **Introduced new philosophy?** Yes. Nominalism's focus on God's will rather than essence. This sounds more biblical (God known through action, not abstract essence), but it's still a philosophical system imposed on Scripture.
- **Anti-Semitism:** Not only perpetuated but amplified. Luther's recommendations were implemented by the Nazis 400 years later.

#### John Calvin (1509-1564)

**Key Ideas:**
- **TULIP** (Five Points of Calvinism):
  - Total depravity — humanity completely corrupted by sin
  - Unconditional election — God chooses who will be saved
  - Limited atonement — Christ died only for the elect
  - Irresistible grace — the elect cannot resist God's call
  - Perseverance of the saints — the elect cannot lose salvation
- God's absolute sovereignty over all things
- Covenant theology — God relates to humanity through covenants
- Wrote *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (1536) — systematic theology

**Philosophical Influences:**
- Like Luther, influenced by **Nominalism** and focus on God's will
- But more systematic and philosophical than Luther
- Used **Augustinian** categories (predestination, grace, depravity)
- Created a comprehensive theological system rivaling medieval scholasticism

**The Tragic Irony:**
Calvin argued against Catholic use of force to enforce doctrine, but then:
- Established a theocracy in Geneva with strict moral enforcement
- Supported execution of heretics (including Michael Servetus, burned at stake in 1553 for denying the Trinity)
- The pattern persists: "We're right; they're wrong; force is justified"

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Mixed. Covenant theology recovers some biblical categories. But TULIP debates use philosophical logic more than biblical narrative.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Yes. Predestination and election debated using Aristotelian logic and Augustinian metaphysics.
- **Introduced new philosophy?** Not really new—systematized existing Augustinian/Nominalist thought.
- **Anti-Semitism:** Less overtly virulent than Luther, but still supersessionist. Covenant theology was often used to argue the church replaced Israel.

#### The Radical Reformation (Anabaptists)

**Key Ideas:**
- Believer's baptism (not infant baptism)
- Separation of church and state
- Pacifism and refusal to swear oaths
- Simple living and community of goods
- Church discipline and mutual accountability

**Key Figures:**
- **Conrad Grebel** (1498-1526): Co-founder of Swiss Brethren
- **Menno Simons** (1496-1561): Mennonite movement founder
- **Jakob Hutter** (d. 1536): Hutterite communities

**The Cost:**
Anabaptists were persecuted by both Catholics AND Protestants:
- Drowned (ironic "rebaptism") by Protestant authorities
- Burned by Catholic authorities
- Hunted and killed across Europe
- Thousands martyred in the Martyrs Mirror

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Arguably closest to Jesus's teachings among Reformation movements. Emphasis on discipleship, simplicity, non-violence, and community reflects Sermon on the Mount.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Least philosophical of all Reformation movements. Focused on practical obedience.
- **Introduced new philosophy?** No—focused on following Jesus's teachings literally.
- **Anti-Semitism:** Less explicitly anti-Semitic, but still supersessionist in covenant theology.

**The Irony:**
The group that most closely followed Jesus's teachings (enemy love, non-violence, simplicity) was killed by both Catholic and Protestant Christians. The Jerusalem Standard—"no further burden"—was violated by those who claimed to be reforming the church.

#### The Anglican Reformation (English Reformation)

**Key Figures:**
- **Henry VIII** (1491-1547): Broke from Rome over annulment issue
- **Thomas Cranmer** (1489-1556): Archbishop of Canterbury, created *Book of Common Prayer*
- **Elizabeth I** (1533-1603): Established the Elizabethan Settlement

**The *Via Media* (Middle Way):**
- Claimed to be "Catholic and Reformed"
- Retained episcopal structure (bishops)
- Reformed doctrine (closer to Protestantism)
- Liturgical worship (Catholic style)

**The Imperial Connection:**
The English Reformation was inseparable from empire:
- Henry VIII broke from Rome to secure succession (and marry Anne Boleyn)
- **Thread 3 in full view:** Political power determined theology
- Later, Anglicanism became the established religion of the British Empire
- Colonial expansion spread Anglicanism worldwide—often by force

**Assessment:**
- **Returned to biblical theology?** Moderate reforms. Emphasized Scripture and vernacular liturgy. But retained much Catholic structure.
- **Perpetuated Greek philosophy?** Yes. The 39 Articles use the same creedal formulas (Nicene, Chalcedonian).
- **Introduced new philosophy?** No. Attempted synthesis of Catholic and Reformed thought.
- **Anti-Semitism:** Standard supersessionism. No improvement over medieval theology.

### The Shift: From God's Nature to God's Will

The Reformation represents a significant philosophical shift, though it's often unrecognized:

**Medieval Scholasticism (Following Aquinas):**
- Primary question: "What is God?"
- Method: Reason + revelation can know God's essence
- God is *actus purus* (pure actuality), *ipsum esse subsistens* (subsistent being itself)
- Aristotelian metaphysics: God as First Cause, Unmoved Mover

**Reformation Nominalism:**
- Primary question: "What does God will?"
- Method: We cannot know God's essence; only His revealed will
- God is known through His actions in history and His Word
- Focus on covenant, election, sovereignty

**Why This Matters:**
The shift from "What is God's nature?" to "What is God's will?" *sounds* more biblical. The Hebrew Scriptures reveal God through His actions: "I am the LORD your God who brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2).

**But Here's the Problem:**
The Reformers still debated God's will using philosophical categories:
- Predestination debates used Aristotelian logic
- Free will vs. sovereignty used scholastic distinctions
- Covenant theology imposed systematic frameworks on Scripture

**What a True Return to Hebrew Categories Would Look Like:**
Instead of debating "Does God predetermine who is saved?" (philosophical question), ask:
- "How do we follow Jesus in community?" (practical question)
- "What does it mean to love God and neighbor?" (relational question)
- "How do we participate in God's redemption of creation?" (missional question)

The Anabaptists came closest to this approach. And they were killed for it.

### The Fragmentation Accelerates

Here's where decentralization reveals its dark side.

**The Catholic Pattern:**
- One church, centralized authority
- When schisms occurred, they were major breaks (East-West, Protestant-Catholic)
- Power concentrated; dissent forcefully suppressed

**The Protestant Pattern:**
- Decentralized authority: *sola scriptura* + priesthood of believers
- Every believer can interpret Scripture
- Result: Exponential fragmentation

**The Timeline of Splitting:**

| Date | Split | Over What? |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **1517** | Luther breaks from Rome | Indulgences, justification, papal authority |
| **1521** | Anabaptist movement begins | Believer's baptism, separation of church and state |
| **1534** | Anglican breaks from Rome | Henry VIII's annulment |
| **1536** | Calvin establishes Geneva | Predestination, church governance |
| **1560s** | Reformed vs. Lutheran disputes | Presence of Christ in communion |
| **1600s** | Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists split | Church governance structures |
| **1700s** | Methodist movement (Wesley) | Revival, holiness, free will vs. predestination |
| **1800s** | Hundreds of denominations emerge | Baptism methods, end times, spiritual gifts, slavery |
| **1900s** | Pentecostal movement, Fundamentalist-Modernist split | Speaking in tongues, biblical inerrancy |
| **2000s** | Thousands of denominations worldwide | Everything imaginable |

**The Sad Math:**
- Catholic and Orthodox: 2 main communions (plus Oriental Orthodox = 3)
- Protestant denominations today: **45,000+** (World Christian Encyclopedia)

**What Happened?**
Once you establish that unity requires perfect doctrinal agreement, and you give every believer authority to interpret Scripture, fragmentation is inevitable. Every theological dispute becomes grounds for split.

The Jerusalem Council said "no further burden." The Reformation said "these doctrines are essential." Then each group defined "essential" differently.

### The Colonialism Connection (Thread 3: The New Empire)

The Reformation coincided with European colonial expansion. Watch how Thread 3 (empire) operates:

**Spanish and Portuguese Empires (Catholic):**
- 1492: Columbus sails; Spanish Inquisition expels Jews
- Colonial conquest justified as spreading Christianity
- Forced conversion of indigenous peoples (encomienda system)
- 1537: Pope Paul III declares indigenous people have souls (but colonization continues)

**British Empire (Protestant/Anglican):**
- Colonial expansion justified as spreading "civilization" and the gospel
- Transatlantic slave trade justified biblically (Ham's curse, Philemon reinterpreted)
- Indigenous peoples "civilized" through Christian education
- Residential schools (continuing into 20th century) forcibly removed children from families

**Dutch Empire (Reformed/Calvinist):**
- Dutch East India Company spread Calvinism alongside trade
- South African apartheid later justified using Reformed theology
- Segregation defended as God's created order

**The Pattern:**
Empire still shapes theology. The difference: now multiple empires back competing Christian traditions. And all perpetuate:
- Supersessionism (Christians replace Jews)
- Colonialism (Europeans "save" non-Europeans)
- Slavery (Africans are cursed, or slavery is biblically permissible)
- Forced conversion (heretics, Jews, indigenous peoples)

**The Theological Gymnastics:**
How did Christians justify slavery, colonialism, and genocide while following Jesus?
- Depersonalized non-Europeans (not fully human, or "less developed")
- Spiritualized salvation (save souls, ignore bodies and justice)
- Dualism (spiritual matters vs. earthly matters—hello, Gnosticism!)
- Predestination (colonizers are elect; colonized are not)

### Did the Reformation Return to Biblical Theology?

**What Was Recovered:**
- Scripture in the people's language ✓
- Direct access to God without priestly mediation ✓
- Justification by faith (not purchased through indulgences) ✓
- Emphasis on God's grace ✓

**What Was NOT Recovered:**
- ✗ Still debating theology using Greek philosophical categories
- ✗ Still supersessionist (church replaces Israel)
- ✗ Still using force to enforce orthodoxy
- ✗ Still prioritizing orthodoxy over orthopraxy
- ✗ Anti-Semitism intensified (Luther)
- ✗ Created exponentially more divisions
- ✗ Partnered with empire (colonialism)

**What Was Made Worse:**
- Fragmentation: From 2-3 main communions to 45,000+ denominations
- Justification for slavery and colonialism (new philosophical/theological frameworks)
- Anti-Semitism: Luther's writings gave theological cover to genocide

### The Jerusalem Standard—Still Ignored

Imagine if the Reformers had followed the Jerusalem Council:

**Instead of:**
"We will create detailed systematic theologies. Those who disagree are heretics. We'll establish competing churches."

**They could have said:**
"We all confess Jesus as Lord. We disagree about predestination, baptism methods, church governance. It seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden. Let's stay in communion while we work through these questions."

**The Result:**
- Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox might have remained in dialogue
- Diversity of worship and theology within one body
- No need for 45,000 denominations
- Fellowship based on Jesus, not perfect doctrinal agreement

But that's not what happened. The Reformation repeated the pattern of Nicaea: philosophical precision, forced uniformity (within each tradition), and division enforced by power.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Martin Luther recovered biblical truths (justification by faith, Scripture in vernacular) but wrote viciously anti-Semitic material that the Nazis quoted. Can we honor his contributions while condemning his anti-Semitism? Or is his legacy permanently tainted?

2. The text argues the Reformation shifted from asking "What is God's essence?" to "What is God's will?" This sounds more biblical—but the debates (predestination, election) still used philosophical logic. Is this an improvement? Or just trading one philosophical system for another?

3. The Anabaptists came closest to Jesus's teachings (non-violence, discipleship, simplicity) and were killed by both Catholics and Protestants. What does this reveal about whose Christianity is considered "orthodox"? Does orthodoxy correlate with power?

4. Today there are 45,000+ Protestant denominations, compared to 2-3 main communions before the Reformation. The text attributes this to rejecting the Jerusalem Standard ("no further burden") in favor of requiring doctrinal precision. Is fragmentation an acceptable price for doctrinal clarity? Or did something go wrong?

5. The Reformation coincided with colonialism, and Reformed theology was used to justify slavery, apartheid, and forced conversion. How did Christians justify these things while following Jesus? Does this reveal something structurally wrong with how we do theology?

6. What would a true return to biblical theology look like? Would it focus on practical questions ("How do we follow Jesus?") rather than metaphysical ones ("What is God's essence?" or "How does predestination work?")? Can we have both?

## Part 6: The Holocaust (1933-1945)

### The Culmination of Christian Anti-Semitism
The Holocaust was not a departure from Christian history. It was its horrifying culmination.

**Hitler's Innovations:**
- Industrial-scale murder (gas chambers, death camps)
- Bureaucratic efficiency (railroad logistics, record-keeping)
- Scientific racism (eugenics, racial hygiene)
- Modern technology in service of ancient hatred

**But the Foundation Was Already Laid:**
- 1,800 years of Christian teaching that Jews were Christ-killers
- Centuries of sermons blaming Jews for every evil
- Legal restrictions that made Jews vulnerable
- Theological supersessionism that said God had rejected the Jews
- A pattern of dehumanization that made genocide thinkable

**Martin Luther's "On the Jews and Their Lies" (1543):**
Luther, hero of the Reformation, wrote:
> "First, their synagogues should be set on fire... Secondly, their homes should likewise be broken down and destroyed... Thirdly, they should be deprived of their prayer books and Talmuds... Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death to teach anymore..."

The Nazis quoted Luther. They built on Christian anti-Semitism. They implemented what Christian theology had been teaching for centuries.

### Six Million
- Six million Jews murdered
- 1.5 million children
- Entire communities erased
- Yiddish culture nearly destroyed
- Families torn apart
- A wound beyond words

**The Silence:**
Many Christians across Europe:
- Looked the other way
- Collaborated with Nazis
- Turned in Jewish neighbors
- Stole Jewish property
- Participated in the killing

Some Christians were righteous:
- Hid Jews in their homes
- Forged documents
- Smuggled children to safety
- Risked their lives to save others

But they were the exception, not the rule.

**The Question That Will Not Go Away:**
How could the Holocaust happen in Christian Europe? How could the people who sang "Jesus loves the little children" murder 1.5 million Jewish children?

The answer: because Christian theology had taught for 1,800 years that Jews were cursed, rejected, deserving of suffering. The Holocaust did not come out of nowhere. It came out of us.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The text argues that the Holocaust was the culmination of 1,800 years of Christian anti-Semitism, not a departure from it. Do you agree? How much responsibility does Christian theology bear for the Holocaust?

2. Martin Luther wrote viciously anti-Semitic material in 1543. The Nazis quoted him. Should Protestants reckon with Luther's legacy differently? Can we honor his contributions to the Reformation while condemning his anti-Semitism?

3. Many Christians across Europe participated in or enabled the Holocaust. Some risked their lives to save Jews. What made the difference? Can we identify theological factors that led to resistance vs. collaboration?

## Part 7: The Glimmer of Hope

### Confronting the Horror
After World War II, Christians could no longer avoid the question: What role did our theology play in the Holocaust?

Some refused to ask. They blamed Hitler, blamed Germany, blamed paganism, blamed everything except the anti-Semitism embedded in Christian teaching.

But others looked honestly at the history and were horrified by what they saw.

### Vatican II and Nostra Aetate (1965)

**The Catholic Church's Response:**
In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued *Nostra Aetate* (In Our Time), a declaration on the relationship between the Catholic Church and non-Christian religions.

**Regarding Jews, it declared:**
1. The Jewish people are not collectively responsible for Jesus's death
2. Jews are not rejected or cursed by God
3. The church decries hatred and persecution of Jews
4. Anti-Semitism is condemned

**The Significance:**
For the first time in 1,800 years, the Catholic Church officially repudiated supersessionism and theological anti-Semitism. This was not a minor adjustment—it was a fundamental reorientation.

**What It Said:**
> "True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures."

**What It Meant:**
- The "Christ-killer" charge is false
- Jews are still in covenant with God
- Christians must oppose anti-Semitism
- Dialogue and reconciliation are possible

### Protestant Responses
Protestant denominations issued similar statements:
- Presbyterian Church (USA) repudiated supersessionism
- Evangelical Lutheran Church in America renounced Luther's anti-Semitic writings
- United Methodist Church affirmed God's covenant with the Jewish people
- Many others followed

**The Common Thread:**
After the Holocaust, churches began to acknowledge that Christian theology had contributed to Jewish suffering. They began to repent.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Vatican II's *Nostra Aetate* (1965) officially repudiated the "Christ-killer" charge and supersessionism. Why did it take until 1965? What changed after the Holocaust that made this possible?

2. The text asks: "Can the church repent of corporate sin?" What would that repentance look like? Is it meaningful to apologize for sins committed by Christians centuries ago?

3. Since 1965, churches have been issuing statements condemning anti-Semitism and repudiating supersessionism. Is this enough? What else needs to happen for healing?

## Part 8: The Door Opens for Healing

### Jacob Neusner and the Academic Revolution (1970s)
Around the same time that churches were repudiating anti-Semitism, something remarkable happened in academic scholarship.

**Jacob Neusner** (1932-2016):
- Jewish literary scholar with Orthodox roots
- Brought Christian scholars to the table with Jewish scholars
- Studied how modern Christian thought influenced Jewish thought
- Opened a dialogue that had been closed for 1,800 years

**The Breakthrough:**
Academic Christians began learning from Jewish scholars:
- How to read the Hebrew Bible in its original context
- The Jewishness of Jesus and Paul
- Rabbinic methods of interpretation
- The richness of Second Temple Judaism

**The Rediscovery:**
> "We never repaired that schism for 1,800 years. We went down our own stream of thought, our own stream of consciousness. We had councils and reformations and great movements, but they were all very Gentile. Now, 1,800 years later, these two worlds collide again, this Jewish and Gentile world, on a scholastic level, on an academic level in the world of scholarship." —Marty Solomon, BEMA Podcast

**The Questions We Didn't Know We Weren't Asking:**
For 1,800 years, Christians approached Scripture without asking basic questions about Jewish context because we didn't have Jewish teachers to teach us what questions to ask.

Now, for the first time since the schism, the questions are being asked again.

### The Recovery Begins
Modern scholarship recovering Jewish roots of Christianity:
- **E.P. Sanders**: *Paul and Palestinian Judaism* (1977)
- **N.T. Wright**: Kingdom theology rooted in Second Temple Judaism
- **Amy-Jill Levine**: Jewish perspectives on Jesus and the New Testament
- **Daniel Boyarin**: Border lines between Judaism and Christianity
- Countless others

**What's Being Recovered:**
- The Jewishness of Jesus's teachings
- Paul's thoroughly Jewish theology
- The cultural context of the Gospels
- The continuity between Old and New Testaments
- The Hebrew worldview underlying Christian Scripture

**The BEMA Podcast:**
> "BEMA is not just indebted—this whole discussion would not happen without the work of Jacob Neusner, period." —Marty Solomon

BEMA represents the collision of two streams:
- Academic scholarship recovering Jewish roots (Neusner and others)
- Grassroots fundamentalism's love for Scripture and Jesus

Both are needed. Neither is sufficient alone. Together, they offer hope for recovery.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Jacob Neusner's work in the 1970s reopened dialogue between Jewish and Christian scholars after 1,800 years. Why is academic scholarship important for healing? What can be learned in universities that can't be learned in churches alone?

2. We are "the first generation in 1,800 years for whom healing is actually possible." What makes our generation different? What opportunities do we have that previous generations did not?

3. How should recovering the Jewish roots of Christianity change how we read the New Testament? What would it mean to read Paul or Jesus with Jewish teachers again?

4. If we lost Text, Community, Discipleship, and Wrestling when we lost our Jewish teachers, what would it look like to recover these? What would a church grounded in Jewish roots look like today?

## Part 9: This Is the Story We Find Ourselves In

### Where We Stand
We are the first generation in 1,800 years for whom healing is actually possible.

**The Wound:**
- AD 114-120: The betrayal and schism
- 2nd-16th centuries: Pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, expulsions
- 1517-1648: Protestant Reformation (fragmentation accelerates, anti-Semitism persists)
- 1492-1900s: Colonial expansion and forced conversion
- 1933-1945: The Holocaust
- 1,800 years of violence rooted in theology

**The Beginning of Healing:**
- 1965: Nostra Aetate and repudiation of supersessionism
- 1970s: Jewish-Christian academic dialogue begins
- Present: Recovery of Jewish roots in Christian scholarship

### The Invitation
We inherit this history. We did not create these wounds, but we live in their aftermath.

**We Cannot:**
- Erase what happened
- Pretend it wasn't that bad
- Blame it all on "those Christians back then"
- Disconnect theology from its consequences

**We Can:**
- Learn the true history
- Repent of corporate sin
- Recover what was lost
- Build relationships with Jewish neighbors
- Read Scripture through Jewish eyes again
- Resist anti-Semitism in all its forms
- Participate in healing

### The Systematic Theology Connection
This history is not just background for theology. It IS theology.

**When we "deconstruct systematic theology," we must ask:**
- Which systems were built without Jewish input?
- Which doctrines absorbed Gnostic assumptions?
- Which formulas require Greek philosophical training?
- Which teachings contributed to violence?
- What did we lose when we lost our Jewish teachers?
- What would recovery look like?

**This is the story we find ourselves in:**
- Born into a church already separated from its Jewish roots for 1,900 years
- Inheriting theological systems forged in that separation
- Living in the first generation where reconnection is possible
- Invited to participate in recovery and healing

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The course ahead is "Deconstructing Systematic Theology." Having now seen how systematic theology developed (separated from Jewish roots, using Greek categories, shaped by Gnostic assumptions, implicated in violence), what questions do you want to bring to that deconstruction?

2. Is there hope? Can we rebuild theology on a different foundation—one that includes Jewish voices, rejects Gnostic dualisms, prioritizes orthopraxy alongside orthodoxy, and resists the violence of forced conformity? What would that theology look like?

## Closing Reflection

We have covered a heavy history. Pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, Holocaust—this is not easy material. It may challenge everything you thought you knew about Christian history.

**But there is hope.**

The door that was slammed shut in AD 114-120 is beginning to open again. Jewish and Christian scholars are talking. Churches are repenting. The Text is coming alive in its Jewish context. The questions we forgot to ask are being asked again.

We did not create these wounds. But we can participate in healing them.

We did not build these theological systems. But we can question, critique, and reconstruct them.

We did not lose our Jewish teachers. But we can learn from their descendants, recover what was lost, and become students again.

**This is the story we find ourselves in.**

Not as perpetrators of ancient crimes, but as inheritors of their legacy. Not as defendants required to justify the past, but as participants invited to shape the future.

The work of recovery has begun. The question is: Will we join it?
