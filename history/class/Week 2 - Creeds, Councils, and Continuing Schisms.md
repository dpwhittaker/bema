# Week 2: Creeds, Councils, and Continuing Schisms

## Church History as Preface to Deconstructing Systematic Theology

### Opening Question
If the church had already lost its Jewish teachers by the early second century, how could the great councils of the fourth and fifth centuries avoid integrating Gnostic presuppositions into their definitions of Christ? What happens when you fight heresy using the same philosophical categories that produced the heresy in the first place?

---

## Part 1: The Constantinian Shift (AD 313)

### From Persecution to Power
In AD 312, Constantine had a vision before the Battle of Milvian Bridge. He saw a cross in the sky with the words "In this sign, conquer." He ordered his soldiers to paint the Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on their shields. He won the battle and attributed his victory to the Christian God.

In AD 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.

**What Actually Happened:**
Constantine did NOT:
- Make Christianity the official religion (that came later under Theodosius)
- Convert immediately (he was baptized on his deathbed)
- Force anyone to become Christian

Constantine DID:
- End persecution of Christians
- Grant Christians legal protections
- Fund church buildings
- Involve himself in church disputes
- Use Christianity to unify a fragmenting empire

### The Flood of Convenience Converts
When Christianity went from persecuted minority to imperial favor, everything changed:
- No longer a cost to being Christian—now there were benefits
- Court officials, soldiers, merchants became "Christian" for social advancement
- Genuine believers mixed with those who saw Christianity as politically expedient
- Church membership exploded but depth of commitment plummeted

**The Gnostic Crisis Returns:**
During persecution, there was no time for theological speculation. Survival required focus on essentials. But when persecution ended and masses of half-educated converts flooded in, Gnostic ideas returned with force:
- What is the relationship between spirit and matter?
- How could Jesus be both God and human?
- Is the material world good or evil?

The church needed to define orthodoxy. But they would do it without Jewish teachers, using Greek philosophical categories, in a context where Gnostic assumptions were already deeply embedded in the culture.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Constantine legalized Christianity but did not make it the official religion. Why does this distinction matter? What changed when Christianity went from persecuted minority to imperial favor?

2. During persecution, the church focused on survival and essentials. When persecution ended and masses of converts flooded in, Gnostic questions returned. What does this tell us about the relationship between cultural pressure and theological clarity?

## Part 2: The Great Councils and Their Controversies

### Council of Nicaea (AD 325) - The Nature of Christ

**The Question:** Is Jesus fully God, or is he a created being?

**The Controversy:**
- **Arius** argued Jesus was the highest of all created beings but not co-eternal with the Father
  - "There was a time when he was not"
  - Jesus was divine but not fully God
- **Athanasius** argued Jesus was "of the same substance" (*homoousios*) as the Father
  - Fully God, co-eternal with the Father
  - Not created but begotten

**The Decision:**
The Council of Nicaea sided with Athanasius and produced the Nicene Creed. Here is the full text (Nicene-Constantinopolitan form, AD 381), with Greek philosophical terms in bold:

> We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
>
> And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only **[*monogenēs*]** Son of God, **begotten** **[*gennēthenta*]** of the Father before all ages, Light from Light, true God from true God, **begotten** not made, **of one Being [*homoousios*]** with the Father; through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.
>
> And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

**Greek Philosophical Terms Not Found in Scripture:**

| Term | Greek | Meaning | Origin |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| *homoousios* | ὁμοούσιος | "of the same substance/essence" | Coined from Greek *ousia* (being/substance)—a term from Aristotelian metaphysics. Ironically, this word was previously used by Gnostics and was initially rejected by some bishops as too philosophical. |
| *ousia* | οὐσία | "substance, essence, being" | Aristotle's *Metaphysics* uses this term to discuss what something fundamentally *is*. The Bible never asks "what is God made of?" |
| *hypostasis* | ὑπόστασις | "subsistence, underlying reality" | Used differently by different councils. Originally meant "substance" (same as *ousia*), later distinguished to mean "person." Platonic/Stoic philosophical terminology. |
| "begotten not made" | γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα | eternal generation | Addresses the metaphysical question of *how* the Son relates to the Father—a question foreign to Hebrew thought, which would simply say "The LORD and his Anointed" (Psalm 2). |
| "Light from Light" | φῶς ἐκ φωτός | emanation metaphor | Neoplatonic imagery of divine emanation, where lower realities "flow" from higher ones. |
| "true God from true God" | θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἐκ θεοῦ ἀληθινοῦ | essence identity | Essence language—defining Jesus by *what he is made of* rather than *who he is in relation to Israel*. |

**What the Bible Actually Says:**
Compare the creed's philosophical precision to how Scripture speaks of Jesus:
- "You are my Son; today I have begotten you" (Psalm 2:7) — relational, covenantal
- "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14) — incarnational, embodied
- "He is the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15) — functional, revelatory
- "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Corinthians 5:19) — missional, salvific

Scripture asks: "Who is Jesus and what has he done?" The creeds ask: "What is Jesus's metaphysical composition?"

**The Gnostic Shadow:**
Notice what's happening: The church is defining Jesus's identity using Greek philosophical categories (substance, essence, being) rather than Hebrew relational categories. The question "What is Jesus made of?" would have sounded strange to first-century Jewish believers who knew him as Messiah, Son of Man, suffering servant.

Without Jewish teachers to say, "You're asking the wrong question," the church debated endlessly about *ousia* (substance) and *hypostasis* (subsistence). These were the very categories Gnosticism used to distinguish spirit from matter.

**The Power of the Creed to Divide:**
The Nicene Creed did not settle the matter—it fractured the church:

| Group | Position | Status Today |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Nicene Christians** | *Homoousios* (same substance) | Became "orthodox" Christianity |
| **Arians** | *Heteroousios* (different substance) | Condemned as heretics; Arian churches persecuted and eventually eliminated |
| **Semi-Arians** | *Homoiousios* (similar substance) | Caught in the middle; eventually absorbed or condemned |
| **Anomoeans** | Unlike the Father in every way | Extreme Arians; condemned |

The difference between *homoousios* (same substance) and *homoiousios* (similar substance) is a single Greek letter: iota. Over this one letter, Christians excommunicated each other, emperors exiled bishops, and communities were torn apart. Edward Gibbon famously remarked that the Roman Empire was convulsed over a diphthong.

**Who Was Lost:**
- Arian Christianity was widespread among Germanic tribes (Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Burgundians) for centuries
- Ulfilas, the apostle to the Goths, was Arian—he translated the Bible into Gothic
- When "orthodox" Christianity triumphed, Arian texts were destroyed, Arian bishops deposed, Arian churches closed
- An entire branch of Christianity was erased from history over a philosophical formula

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Council of Nicaea used the Greek word *homoousios* ("of the same substance") to define Christ's relationship to the Father. Why was philosophical precision necessary? What might have been lost in translating Jewish categories into Greek philosophy?

2. The text argues that the councils were "fighting heresy using the same philosophical categories that produced the heresy." What does this mean? Can you fight Gnosticism while using Gnostic categories?

3. Gnosticism taught that matter is evil and spirit is good. How might this assumption have influenced the debates about Christ's nature? What would a fully Jewish (non-Gnostic) Christology look like?

### Council of Constantinople (AD 381) - The Holy Spirit

**The Question:** Is the Holy Spirit fully God, or a created force?

**The Decision:**
The council expanded the Nicene Creed to affirm the full divinity of the Holy Spirit:
> "We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified..."

**The Problem:**
The phrase "and the Son" (*filioque* in Latin) was added by Western churches later. The East never accepted this addition. This single word would eventually contribute to the Great Schism of 1054.

### Council of Ephesus (AD 431) - Mary as Theotokos

**The Question:** Can Mary be called "Mother of God" (*Theotokos*) or only "Mother of Christ" (*Christotokos*)?

**The Controversy:**
- **Nestorius** argued for "Mother of Christ" to preserve the distinction between Jesus's divine and human natures
- **Cyril of Alexandria** argued for "Mother of God" to affirm that Jesus was one person, not two separate beings in proximity

**The Decision:**
The council sided with Cyril. Mary is *Theotokos* (God-bearer) because Jesus is one person—fully God and fully human, not two persons sharing a body.

**The Power of the Creed to Divide:**
Nestorius was condemned as a heretic and exiled. But his followers did not disappear:

| Group | Position | Continuing Communities |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **Ephesian Christians** | Mary is *Theotokos* (God-bearer) | Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, later Protestant |
| **Nestorian Christians** | Mary is *Christotokos* (Christ-bearer) | **Church of the East** (Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian Christianity) |

**Who Was Separated:**
- The Church of the East (often called "Nestorian," though they reject the label) became a separate communion
- They spread Christianity across Persia, Central Asia, India, and China—reaching as far as Tang Dynasty China by AD 635
- The Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, and the Chaldean Catholic Church descend from this tradition
- Today: approximately 500,000 members worldwide, mostly Iraqi and Iranian Christians
- Separated for 1,600 years over the title of Mary—a dispute rooted in Greek philosophical categories about natures and persons

**The Gnostic Shadow:**
Nestorius's fear of calling Mary "Mother of God" reveals Gnostic assumptions: if God is pure spirit and matter is corrupt, how could God truly become human? How could divinity touch humanity without being contaminated? The very fact that this was controversial shows how far the church had drifted from Jewish categories.

A first-century Jew would have had no problem with this. "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14). God tabernacled in Mary's womb just as he tabernacled in the wilderness. The Incarnation is scandalous precisely because God embraces the material world he created "very good."

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Nestorius was condemned as a heretic for being uncomfortable calling Mary "Mother of God." The text suggests his discomfort reveals Gnostic assumptions about spirit and matter. Do you agree? What does the Incarnation ("the Word became flesh") say about the material world?

2. The text says the Incarnation is "scandalous precisely because God embraces the material world he created 'very good.'" How does this challenge Gnostic thinking? How does it challenge modern evangelical spirituality that often treats the physical world as less important than the spiritual?

### Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) - Two Natures United

**The Question:** How can Jesus be fully God and fully human?

**The Decision:**
The Chalcedonian Definition declared that Christ is:
- One person (*hypostasis*)
- Two natures (divine and human)
- "Without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"
- The distinction of natures is preserved in the union

**The Full Text:**
> Following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice teach the confession of one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same **perfect [*teleion*]** in **divinity [*theotētos*]** and **perfect [*teleion*]** in **humanity [*anthrōpotētos*]**, the same truly God and truly man, of a **rational soul [*psychēs logikēs*]** and a body; **consubstantial [*homoousion*]** with the Father as regards his **divinity [*theotēta*]**, and the same **consubstantial [*homoousion*]** with us as regards his **humanity [*anthrōpotēta*]**; like us in all respects except for sin; begotten before the ages from the Father as regards his divinity, and in the last days the same for us and for our salvation from Mary, the virgin **God-bearer [*theotokos*]**, as regards his humanity;
>
> one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, acknowledged in two **natures [*physesin*]** which undergo no confusion, no change, no separation, no division; at no point was the difference between the **natures [*physeōn*]** taken away through the union, but rather the property of both **natures [*physeōs*]** is preserved and comes together into a single **person [*prosōpon*]** and a single **subsistent being [*hypostasin*]**; he is not parted or divided into two **persons [*prosōpa*]**, but is one and the same only-begotten Son, God, Word, Lord Jesus Christ...

**Greek Philosophical Terms Not Found in Scripture:**

| Term | Greek | Meaning | Philosophical Origin |
|------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| *physis* (nature) | φύσις | "nature, essence, constitution" | Aristotle's concept of what makes something the kind of thing it is. Used 14 times in the Definition. The Bible never discusses Jesus's "natures." |
| *hypostasis* (subsistence) | ὑπόστασις | "underlying reality, person" | Technical term from Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy meaning the concrete individual existence of something. |
| *prosōpon* (person) | πρόσωπον | "face, mask, person" | Originally meant a theatrical mask; evolved to mean "person" in philosophical discourse. |
| *homoousion* (consubstantial) | ὁμοούσιον | "of the same substance" | Same Nicene term applied now to Christ's humanity as well as divinity. |
| *teleion* (perfect/complete) | τέλειον | "complete, perfect, fully realized" | Aristotelian concept of something reaching its full *telos* (purpose/end). |
| "rational soul" | ψυχῆς λογικῆς | "soul possessing reason" | Platonic anthropology distinguishing rational soul from animal soul. Hebrew *nephesh* has no such division. |
| The Four Negatives | ἀσυγχύτως, ἀτρέπτως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀχωρίστως | "without confusion, change, division, separation" | Apophatic (negative) theology—defining by what something is *not*. A distinctly Greek philosophical method. Hebrew thought defines by story and action, not by negation. |

**The Apophatic Method:**
Notice the four negatives: *without* confusion, *without* change, *without* division, *without* separation. This is apophatic theology—defining something by stating what it is not. This method comes directly from Greek philosophy (especially Neoplatonism), where the ultimate reality is so transcendent it can only be described by negation.

Hebrew Scripture, by contrast, defines God through narrative action: "I am the LORD your God who brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2). God is known by what he *does*, not by what he metaphysically is *not*.

**What Was Gained:**
The Chalcedonian formula protected against:
- Arianism (Jesus is not fully God)
- Docetism (Jesus only seemed human)
- Nestorianism (Jesus is two separate persons)
- Eutychianism (Jesus's divine and human natures merged into one new thing)

**What Was Lost:**
But notice: We're still working in Greek philosophical categories (nature, substance, person, essence). We're trying to define mystery using precise metaphysical language. This is Hellenistic methodology, not Hebrew methodology.

A Jewish approach would say: "Jesus is the Word made flesh. He is Immanuel, God with us. He is the fullness of deity dwelling bodily. He sat down at wells and got hungry and died and rose again. This is who Messiah is. Now follow him."

Instead, we created a formula that protected orthodoxy but required a philosophical education to understand.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Chalcedonian Definition says Jesus is "one person, two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." Can you explain what this means? If you can't, does that reveal a problem with requiring philosophical formulas for orthodoxy?

2. The text says we created "formulas that protected orthodoxy but required a philosophical education to understand." Is this a problem? Should theology be accessible to ordinary believers, or does protecting truth require technical precision?

3. The creeds (Nicene, Chalcedonian) are considered foundational to orthodox Christianity. But if they were formulated using Greek categories, without Jewish teachers, in a context already influenced by Gnosticism, do we need to deconstruct them? Can we affirm what they protect while questioning how they were formulated?

## Part 3: From Orthodoxy to Orthopraxy - What Got Lost

### The Shift in Focus
Before Constantine: **Orthopraxy** (right practice) was primary
- How do we follow Jesus?
- How do we love our enemies?
- How do we care for the poor?
- How do we live as a subversive community under empire?

After the councils: **Orthodoxy** (right belief) became primary
- Do you affirm the *homoousios*?
- Do you confess the hypostatic union?
- Do you accept Chalcedonian Christology?

**Both Matter:**
This is not to say doctrine doesn't matter. Of course it matters who Jesus is! But the shift in emphasis had profound consequences:
- You could be "orthodox" (affirm the creeds) while living in blatant contradiction to Jesus's teachings
- Theological precision became more important than loving your neighbor
- Defining Jesus correctly became more important than following Jesus faithfully

**The Counterfactual:**
If the church had not lost its Jewish teachers, would we have:
- Focused more on following Jesus's way than defining his essence?
- Used relational language instead of philosophical categories?
- Emphasized covenant faithfulness over credal precision?
- Maintained the link between belief and practice that Torah embodied?

We cannot know. But the question should haunt us.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Before Constantine, the church emphasized *orthopraxy* (right practice); after the councils, *orthodoxy* (right belief) became primary. Why does this shift matter? Can you be orthodox without being faithful? Can you be faithful without being orthodox?

2. The text suggests Torah embodied a link between belief and practice that the church lost. What does this mean? How might recovering this connection change our approach to theology?

---

## Part 4: Continuing Schisms

### Chalcedonian vs. Non-Chalcedonian Churches
Not everyone accepted Chalcedon. The council split the church into communions that remain separate to this day:

| Tradition | Position on Christ's Nature | Member Churches | Approximate Members Today |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Chalcedonian** | Two natures (divine and human) in one person | Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant | ~2.4 billion |
| **Oriental Orthodox** | One united nature (*miaphysis*) after the union | Coptic, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Syriac, Armenian, Malankara | ~60 million |
| **Church of the East** | Two natures, two *qnome* (distinct) | Assyrian, Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean | ~500,000 |

**Oriental Orthodox Churches** (rejected Chalcedon as "Nestorian"):
- **Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria** — Egypt (~15-20 million)
- **Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church** — Ethiopia (~45 million, largest Oriental Orthodox body)
- **Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church** — Eritrea (~2.5 million)
- **Syriac Orthodox Church** — Middle East, India (~3-4 million)
- **Armenian Apostolic Church** — Armenia, diaspora (~9 million)
- **Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church** — India (~2.5 million)

**Chalcedonian Churches** (accepted Chalcedon):
- Roman Catholic Church
- Eastern Orthodox Churches (Greek, Russian, Serbian, Romanian, etc.)
- Later, Protestant churches

**The Tragedy of Miaphysitism:**
The Oriental Orthodox churches are often wrongly called "Monophysite" (one nature), implying they believe Jesus was only divine. In fact, they confess *miaphysis*—one *united* nature that is fully divine and fully human. Their disagreement with Chalcedon may be more linguistic than substantive.

In 1990, Pope John Paul II and Coptic Pope Shenouda III signed a common declaration affirming they hold the same faith about Christ. Similar agreements exist between Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches. After 1,500 years, theologians now suggest they were saying the same thing in different Greek philosophical vocabularies.

**The Question That Haunts:**
If the division was largely semantic—a matter of which Greek philosophical terms to use—what does this say about using philosophical precision as a test of orthodoxy? How many Christians were separated from each other over *words* rather than *faith*?

These communities remain separated to this day over language about Christ's nature—language formulated in Greek philosophical categories, debated without Jewish input, in a context already saturated with Gnostic assumptions about spirit and matter.

### The Great East-West Schism (AD 1054)

**Different Cultures, Different Methods:**
- **The West** (Latin, Roman): Preserved truth through *words* (doctrine, creeds, definitions)
- **The East** (Greek, Byzantine): Preserved truth through *images* (icons, liturgy, beauty)

**The Iconoclastic Controversy (8th-9th centuries):**
Byzantine Emperor Leo III ordered destruction of icons. The controversy raged:
- **Iconoclasts** said icons violated the prohibition against graven images (Exodus 20:4)
- **Iconodules** said the Incarnation changed everything—if God took on flesh, matter can bear divine presence

The Second Council of Nicaea (787) affirmed icons, distinguishing between *latria* (worship for God alone) and *proskynesis* (veneration offered to icons).

**The Western Critique:**
To Western eyes, venerating icons looked like idolatry. The sophisticated Eastern theology didn't compute within Western categories.

**The Eastern Counter-Critique:**
But couldn't the West be accused of "doctrinal idolatry"? If venerating an icon can become idolatry, couldn't venerating a doctrine become idolatry too? You can worship your theological system instead of the God it describes.

**The Final Break (1054):**
Disputes accumulated:
- The *filioque* controversy (does the Spirit proceed from Father alone, or Father "and Son"?)
- Papal authority (is the Pope supreme, or first among equals?)
- Liturgical differences (unleavened vs. leavened bread, married vs. celibate clergy)

Cardinal Humbert placed a bull of excommunication on the altar of Hagia Sophia. Patriarch Michael Cerularius responded with his own excommunication. The Great Schism divided Christendom into Catholic West and Orthodox East.

**The Mutual Excommunications Were Not Lifted Until 1965.**
Full communion was never restored. The wound is still open.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The East preserved truth through icons; the West through doctrines. Each accused the other of idolatry. Can both be partially right? What do we need from both traditions?

2. The Eastern critique asks: Can you worship your theological system instead of God? Have you ever seen this happen? How do we guard against "doctrinal idolatry"?

3. The *filioque* controversy (does the Spirit proceed from Father alone, or Father "and Son"?) divided East and West. Does this seem like a meaningful theological difference or a minor linguistic dispute? Why did it matter enough to split the church?

4. The Great Schism of 1054 has never been healed. What would reconciliation between Catholic and Orthodox churches look like? What prevents it?

---

## Part 5: A Different Model — The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15)

Before examining the pattern that emerges, we must ask: Was there ever a different way? Did the early church have a model for resolving theological disputes that aimed at unity rather than precision?

There was. And we find it in the Jerusalem Council.

### The Crisis (Acts 15:1-5)
Some believers from Judea came to Antioch teaching: "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved." This was not a minor dispute—it struck at the heart of the gospel. Paul and Barnabas had "no small dissension and debate" with them.

**The Question:** Must Gentiles become Jews to follow Jesus?

This was every bit as theologically significant as the later creedal controversies. It touched on:
- The nature of salvation (by grace or by works of the law?)
- The identity of God's people (ethnic Israel or a new multinational community?)
- The authority of Torah (binding on all believers or fulfilled in Christ?)
- The relationship between Jew and Gentile (equal or hierarchical?)

### The Method (Acts 15:6-21)

**How They Approached the Problem:**

| Jerusalem Council (AD ~49) | Later Ecumenical Councils (4th-5th century) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Jewish apostles and elders led the discussion | Greek-educated bishops dominated |
| Peter and James spoke from *experience* and *Scripture* | Debates focused on Greek philosophical categories |
| Goal: "How can we worship together?" | Goal: "What is the precise metaphysical definition?" |
| Result: Minimum requirements for table fellowship | Result: Detailed creeds requiring theological education |
| **Unity preserved; diversity maintained** | **Uniformity demanded; diversity condemned** |

**Peter's Argument (15:7-11):**
Peter didn't offer a philosophical definition. He told a story: "God chose me to bring the gospel to the Gentiles. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us. He made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith."

Then his conclusion: "Why put a yoke on their necks that neither we nor our ancestors could bear? We believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will."

**James's Ruling (15:13-21):**
James quoted the prophet Amos (9:11-12) and made a practical ruling. Notice what he did NOT do:
- He did not define the metaphysical relationship between law and grace
- He did not create a formula for the nature of salvation
- He did not demand that everyone use the same theological vocabulary
- He did not excommunicate those who disagreed

Instead, he said: "We should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God, but we should write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from fornication, from whatever has been strangled, and from blood" (15:19-20).

### The Letter (Acts 15:23-29)

> The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the believers of Gentile origin in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. Since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us, though with no instructions from us, have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds, we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you... For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you **no further burden** than these essentials: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.

**"No Further Burden"** — This is the opposite of the creedal councils that followed. The Jerusalem Council sought the *minimum* requirements for communion, not the *maximum* precision of definition.

### The Contrast

| Aspect | Jerusalem Council | Nicaea/Chalcedon |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **Language** | Hebrew/Aramaic thought patterns | Greek philosophical categories |
| **Leaders** | Jewish apostles | Gentile bishops |
| **Method** | Story, Scripture, experience | Metaphysical definition |
| **Goal** | "No further burden" — minimize requirements | Maximize precision — detailed formulas |
| **Result** | Unity in diversity | Division over definitions |
| **Dissenters** | Addressed pastorally | Condemned, exiled, excommunicated |
| **Test of Fellowship** | Practical: avoid idolatry, sexual immorality | Intellectual: affirm correct formula |

### What If?

What if the later councils had followed the Jerusalem model?

- What if, instead of asking "What is Christ's metaphysical composition?", they had asked "What must we confess to worship together?"
- What if, instead of precise Greek formulas, they had used the biblical language already shared by all Christians?
- What if, instead of condemning those who used different terminology, they had sought the minimum requirements for table fellowship?
- What if the goal had been unity rather than uniformity?

We cannot know. But the Jerusalem Council stands as a witness: there was another way. The church chose a different path.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Jerusalem Council sought the *minimum* requirements for fellowship; the later creeds sought *maximum* precision. Which approach is wiser? Is there a place for both?

2. Peter argued from experience ("God gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us") rather than from philosophical definition. How might church history have been different if later councils had followed this method?

3. The Jerusalem letter says "it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" — a remarkable claim of Spirit-led consensus. Do you think the later councils could make the same claim? What's the difference between Spirit-led unity and politically-enforced uniformity?

4. James's ruling included practical requirements (avoid idol meat, sexual immorality, blood) but no theological formulas. Why might practical requirements preserve unity better than doctrinal tests? Or do doctrinal tests serve an important purpose?

## Part 6: The Pattern Emerges

Look at what's happened:
1. **AD 114-120**: Gentile Christians betray Jewish family, lose connection to Text and Jewish interpretation
2. **2nd-3rd centuries**: Gnostic ideas fill the vacuum, Marcionite assumptions absorbed
3. **4th-5th centuries**: Councils respond to heresies using Greek philosophical categories without Jewish input
4. **5th century onward**: Churches split over precise definitions formulated in those categories
5. **11th century**: East and West split over methodology (words vs. images)
6. **16th century** (preview for next week): Protestant Reformation splits the West again

**The Common Thread:**
Every division flows from the original schism. Without Jewish teachers:
- We lost the Text's original context
- We adopted Greek philosophical methods
- We emphasized orthodoxy over orthopraxy
- We created formulas that required philosophical education
- We divided over distinctions that would have seemed foreign to first-century believers

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The pattern that emerges is: schism → loss of context → Gnostic infiltration → councils without Jewish input → more schisms. If this pattern is accurate, what does it suggest about how we approach theology today?

2. Marcion wanted to reject the Hebrew Bible entirely. The church said no—but then functionally ignored the Old Testament for centuries. Are we Marcionites in practice even if not in theory? How would recovering the Old Testament change our theology?

3. Next week we'll look at the long-term consequences: Crusades, Inquisition, Holocaust. How do you think the theological developments we've discussed this week connect to those atrocities? Can bad theology lead to violence?

---

## For Next Week

Next week we explore the darkest chapters of Christian history: pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, and the Holocaust. We'll see how theological anti-Semitism—rooted in the betrayal of AD 114-120 and reinforced by centuries of teaching—led to unimaginable violence.

But we'll also explore hope: how the Holocaust finally forced the church to confront its anti-Semitism, leading to Nostra Aetate (1965) and the beginning of Jewish-Christian dialogue. After 1,800 years of separation, the wound might finally begin to heal.

Come prepared to discuss: Can the church repent of corporate sin? What would it mean to take responsibility for atrocities committed by Christians centuries ago?
