# Week 2: Creeds, Councils, and Continuing Schisms

## Church History as Preface to Deconstructing Systematic Theology

### Opening Question
If the church had already lost its Jewish teachers by the early second century, how could the great councils of the fourth and fifth centuries avoid integrating Gnostic presuppositions into their definitions of Christ? What happens when you fight heresy using the same philosophical categories that produced the heresy in the first place?

---

## Part 1: The Constantinian Shift (AD 313)

### From Persecution to Power
In AD 312, Constantine had a vision before the Battle of Milvian Bridge. He saw a cross in the sky with the words "In this sign, conquer." He ordered his soldiers to paint the Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on their shields. He won the battle and attributed his victory to the Christian God.

In AD 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.

**What Actually Happened:**
Constantine did NOT:
- Make Christianity the official religion (that came later under Theodosius)
- Convert immediately (he was baptized on his deathbed)
- Force anyone to become Christian

Constantine DID:
- End persecution of Christians
- Grant Christians legal protections
- Fund church buildings
- Involve himself in church disputes
- Use Christianity to unify a fragmenting empire

### The Flood of Convenience Converts
When Christianity went from persecuted minority to imperial favor, everything changed:
- No longer a cost to being Christian—now there were benefits
- Court officials, soldiers, merchants became "Christian" for social advancement
- Genuine believers mixed with those who saw Christianity as politically expedient
- Church membership exploded but depth of commitment plummeted

**The Gnostic Crisis Returns:**
During persecution, there was no time for theological speculation. Survival required focus on essentials. But when persecution ended and masses of half-educated converts flooded in, Gnostic ideas returned with force:
- What is the relationship between spirit and matter?
- How could Jesus be both God and human?
- Is the material world good or evil?

The church needed to define orthodoxy. But they would do it without Jewish teachers, using Greek philosophical categories, in a context where Gnostic assumptions were already deeply embedded in the culture.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Constantine legalized Christianity but did not make it the official religion. Why does this distinction matter? What changed when Christianity went from persecuted minority to imperial favor?

2. During persecution, the church focused on survival and essentials. When persecution ended and masses of converts flooded in, Gnostic questions returned. What does this tell us about the relationship between cultural pressure and theological clarity?

## Part 2: The Great Councils and Their Controversies

### Council of Nicaea (AD 325) - The Nature of Christ

**The Question:** Is Jesus fully God, or is he a created being?

**The Controversy:**
- **Arius** argued Jesus was the highest of all created beings but not co-eternal with the Father
  - "There was a time when he was not"
  - Jesus was divine but not fully God
- **Athanasius** argued Jesus was "of the same substance" (*homoousios*) as the Father
  - Fully God, co-eternal with the Father
  - Not created but begotten

**The Decision:**
The Council of Nicaea sided with Athanasius and produced the Nicene Creed:
> "We believe... in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father..."

**The Gnostic Shadow:**
Notice what's happening: The church is defining Jesus's identity using Greek philosophical categories (substance, essence, being) rather than Hebrew relational categories. The question "What is Jesus made of?" would have sounded strange to first-century Jewish believers who knew him as Messiah, Son of Man, suffering servant.

Without Jewish teachers to say, "You're asking the wrong question," the church debated endlessly about *ousia* (substance) and *hypostasis* (subsistence). These were the very categories Gnosticism used to distinguish spirit from matter.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Council of Nicaea used the Greek word *homoousios* ("of the same substance") to define Christ's relationship to the Father. Why was philosophical precision necessary? What might have been lost in translating Jewish categories into Greek philosophy?

2. The text argues that the councils were "fighting heresy using the same philosophical categories that produced the heresy." What does this mean? Can you fight Gnosticism while using Gnostic categories?

3. Gnosticism taught that matter is evil and spirit is good. How might this assumption have influenced the debates about Christ's nature? What would a fully Jewish (non-Gnostic) Christology look like?

### Council of Constantinople (AD 381) - The Holy Spirit

**The Question:** Is the Holy Spirit fully God, or a created force?

**The Decision:**
The council expanded the Nicene Creed to affirm the full divinity of the Holy Spirit:
> "We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified..."

**The Problem:**
The phrase "and the Son" (*filioque* in Latin) was added by Western churches later. The East never accepted this addition. This single word would eventually contribute to the Great Schism of 1054.

### Council of Ephesus (AD 431) - Mary as Theotokos

**The Question:** Can Mary be called "Mother of God" (*Theotokos*) or only "Mother of Christ" (*Christotokos*)?

**The Controversy:**
- **Nestorius** argued for "Mother of Christ" to preserve the distinction between Jesus's divine and human natures
- **Cyril of Alexandria** argued for "Mother of God" to affirm that Jesus was one person, not two separate beings in proximity

**The Decision:**
The council sided with Cyril. Mary is *Theotokos* (God-bearer) because Jesus is one person—fully God and fully human, not two persons sharing a body.

**The Gnostic Shadow:**
Nestorius's fear of calling Mary "Mother of God" reveals Gnostic assumptions: if God is pure spirit and matter is corrupt, how could God truly become human? How could divinity touch humanity without being contaminated? The very fact that this was controversial shows how far the church had drifted from Jewish categories.

A first-century Jew would have had no problem with this. "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14). God tabernacled in Mary's womb just as he tabernacled in the wilderness. The Incarnation is scandalous precisely because God embraces the material world he created "very good."

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Nestorius was condemned as a heretic for being uncomfortable calling Mary "Mother of God." The text suggests his discomfort reveals Gnostic assumptions about spirit and matter. Do you agree? What does the Incarnation ("the Word became flesh") say about the material world?

2. The text says the Incarnation is "scandalous precisely because God embraces the material world he created 'very good.'" How does this challenge Gnostic thinking? How does it challenge modern evangelical spirituality that often treats the physical world as less important than the spiritual?

### Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) - Two Natures United

**The Question:** How can Jesus be fully God and fully human?

**The Decision:**
The Chalcedonian Definition declared that Christ is:
- One person (*hypostasis*)
- Two natures (divine and human)
- "Without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"
- The distinction of natures is preserved in the union

**The Language:**
> "We confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at once complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly man... recognized in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation..."

**What Was Gained:**
The Chalcedonian formula protected against:
- Arianism (Jesus is not fully God)
- Docetism (Jesus only seemed human)
- Nestorianism (Jesus is two separate persons)
- Eutychianism (Jesus's divine and human natures merged into one new thing)

**What Was Lost:**
But notice: We're still working in Greek philosophical categories (nature, substance, person, essence). We're trying to define mystery using precise metaphysical language. This is Hellenistic methodology, not Hebrew methodology.

A Jewish approach would say: "Jesus is the Word made flesh. He is Immanuel, God with us. He is the fullness of deity dwelling bodily. He sat down at wells and got hungry and died and rose again. This is who Messiah is. Now follow him."

Instead, we created a formula that protected orthodoxy but required a philosophical education to understand.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Chalcedonian Definition says Jesus is "one person, two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." Can you explain what this means? If you can't, does that reveal a problem with requiring philosophical formulas for orthodoxy?

2. The text says we created "formulas that protected orthodoxy but required a philosophical education to understand." Is this a problem? Should theology be accessible to ordinary believers, or does protecting truth require technical precision?

3. The creeds (Nicene, Chalcedonian) are considered foundational to orthodox Christianity. But if they were formulated using Greek categories, without Jewish teachers, in a context already influenced by Gnosticism, do we need to deconstruct them? Can we affirm what they protect while questioning how they were formulated?

## Part 3: From Orthodoxy to Orthopraxy - What Got Lost

### The Shift in Focus
Before Constantine: **Orthopraxy** (right practice) was primary
- How do we follow Jesus?
- How do we love our enemies?
- How do we care for the poor?
- How do we live as a subversive community under empire?

After the councils: **Orthodoxy** (right belief) became primary
- Do you affirm the *homoousios*?
- Do you confess the hypostatic union?
- Do you accept Chalcedonian Christology?

**Both Matter:**
This is not to say doctrine doesn't matter. Of course it matters who Jesus is! But the shift in emphasis had profound consequences:
- You could be "orthodox" (affirm the creeds) while living in blatant contradiction to Jesus's teachings
- Theological precision became more important than loving your neighbor
- Defining Jesus correctly became more important than following Jesus faithfully

**The Counterfactual:**
If the church had not lost its Jewish teachers, would we have:
- Focused more on following Jesus's way than defining his essence?
- Used relational language instead of philosophical categories?
- Emphasized covenant faithfulness over credal precision?
- Maintained the link between belief and practice that Torah embodied?

We cannot know. But the question should haunt us.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Before Constantine, the church emphasized *orthopraxy* (right practice); after the councils, *orthodoxy* (right belief) became primary. Why does this shift matter? Can you be orthodox without being faithful? Can you be faithful without being orthodox?

2. The text suggests Torah embodied a link between belief and practice that the church lost. What does this mean? How might recovering this connection change our approach to theology?

## Part 4: Continuing Schisms

### Chalcedonian vs. Non-Chalcedonian Churches
Not everyone accepted Chalcedon. The council split the church:

**Oriental Orthodox Churches** (rejected Chalcedon):
- Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria
- Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church
- Armenian Apostolic Church
- Others

**Chalcedonian Churches** (accepted Chalcedon):
- Roman Catholic Church
- Eastern Orthodox Churches
- Later, Protestant churches

These communities remain separated to this day over language about Christ's nature—language formulated in Greek philosophical categories, debated without Jewish input, in a context already saturated with Gnostic assumptions about spirit and matter.

### The Great East-West Schism (AD 1054)

**Different Cultures, Different Methods:**
- **The West** (Latin, Roman): Preserved truth through *words* (doctrine, creeds, definitions)
- **The East** (Greek, Byzantine): Preserved truth through *images* (icons, liturgy, beauty)

**The Iconoclastic Controversy (8th-9th centuries):**
Byzantine Emperor Leo III ordered destruction of icons. The controversy raged:
- **Iconoclasts** said icons violated the prohibition against graven images (Exodus 20:4)
- **Iconodules** said the Incarnation changed everything—if God took on flesh, matter can bear divine presence

The Second Council of Nicaea (787) affirmed icons, distinguishing between *latria* (worship for God alone) and *proskynesis* (veneration offered to icons).

**The Western Critique:**
To Western eyes, venerating icons looked like idolatry. The sophisticated Eastern theology didn't compute within Western categories.

**The Eastern Counter-Critique:**
But couldn't the West be accused of "doctrinal idolatry"? If venerating an icon can become idolatry, couldn't venerating a doctrine become idolatry too? You can worship your theological system instead of the God it describes.

**The Final Break (1054):**
Disputes accumulated:
- The *filioque* controversy (does the Spirit proceed from Father alone, or Father "and Son"?)
- Papal authority (is the Pope supreme, or first among equals?)
- Liturgical differences (unleavened vs. leavened bread, married vs. celibate clergy)

Cardinal Humbert placed a bull of excommunication on the altar of Hagia Sophia. Patriarch Michael Cerularius responded with his own excommunication. The Great Schism divided Christendom into Catholic West and Orthodox East.

**The Mutual Excommunications Were Not Lifted Until 1965.**
Full communion was never restored. The wound is still open.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The East preserved truth through icons; the West through doctrines. Each accused the other of idolatry. Can both be partially right? What do we need from both traditions?

2. The Eastern critique asks: Can you worship your theological system instead of God? Have you ever seen this happen? How do we guard against "doctrinal idolatry"?

3. The *filioque* controversy (does the Spirit proceed from Father alone, or Father "and Son"?) divided East and West. Does this seem like a meaningful theological difference or a minor linguistic dispute? Why did it matter enough to split the church?

4. The Great Schism of 1054 has never been healed. What would reconciliation between Catholic and Orthodox churches look like? What prevents it?

## Part 5: The Pattern Emerges

Look at what's happened:
1. **AD 114-120**: Gentile Christians betray Jewish family, lose connection to Text and Jewish interpretation
2. **2nd-3rd centuries**: Gnostic ideas fill the vacuum, Marcionite assumptions absorbed
3. **4th-5th centuries**: Councils respond to heresies using Greek philosophical categories without Jewish input
4. **5th century onward**: Churches split over precise definitions formulated in those categories
5. **11th century**: East and West split over methodology (words vs. images)
6. **16th century** (preview for next week): Protestant Reformation splits the West again

**The Common Thread:**
Every division flows from the original schism. Without Jewish teachers:
- We lost the Text's original context
- We adopted Greek philosophical methods
- We emphasized orthodoxy over orthopraxy
- We created formulas that required philosophical education
- We divided over distinctions that would have seemed foreign to first-century believers

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The pattern that emerges is: schism → loss of context → Gnostic infiltration → councils without Jewish input → more schisms. If this pattern is accurate, what does it suggest about how we approach theology today?

2. Marcion wanted to reject the Hebrew Bible entirely. The church said no—but then functionally ignored the Old Testament for centuries. Are we Marcionites in practice even if not in theory? How would recovering the Old Testament change our theology?

3. Next week we'll look at the long-term consequences: Crusades, Inquisition, Holocaust. How do you think the theological developments we've discussed this week connect to those atrocities? Can bad theology lead to violence?

## For Next Week

Next week we explore the darkest chapters of Christian history: pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, and the Holocaust. We'll see how theological anti-Semitism—rooted in the betrayal of AD 114-120 and reinforced by centuries of teaching—led to unimaginable violence.

But we'll also explore hope: how the Holocaust finally forced the church to confront its anti-Semitism, leading to Nostra Aetate (1965) and the beginning of Jewish-Christian dialogue. After 1,800 years of separation, the wound might finally begin to heal.

Come prepared to discuss: Can the church repent of corporate sin? What would it mean to take responsibility for atrocities committed by Christians centuries ago?
