# Week 2: Creeds, Councils, and Continuing Schisms

## Church History as Preface to Deconstructing Systematic Theology

### Opening Question
If the church had already lost its Jewish teachers by the early second century, how could the great councils of the fourth and fifth centuries avoid integrating Gnostic presuppositions into their definitions of Christ? What happens when you fight heresy using the same philosophical categories that produced the heresy in the first place?

---

## Part 1: The Constantinian Shift (AD 313)

### From Persecution to Power
In AD 312, Constantine had a vision before the Battle of Milvian Bridge. He saw a cross in the sky with the words "In this sign, conquer." He ordered his soldiers to paint the Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on their shields. He won the battle and attributed his victory to the Christian God.

In AD 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.

**What Actually Happened:**
Constantine did NOT:
- Make Christianity the official religion (that came later under Theodosius)
- Convert immediately (he was baptized on his deathbed)
- Force anyone to become Christian

Constantine DID:
- End persecution of Christians
- Grant Christians legal protections
- Fund church buildings
- Involve himself in church disputes
- Use Christianity to unify a fragmenting empire

### The Flood of Convenience Converts
When Christianity went from persecuted minority to imperial favor, everything changed:
- No longer a cost to being Christian—now there were benefits
- Court officials, soldiers, merchants became "Christian" for social advancement
- Genuine believers mixed with those who saw Christianity as politically expedient
- Church membership exploded but depth of commitment plummeted

**The Gnostic Crisis Returns:**
During persecution, there was no time for theological speculation. Survival required focus on essentials. But when persecution ended and masses of half-educated converts flooded in, Gnostic ideas returned with force:
- What is the relationship between spirit and matter?
- How could Jesus be both God and human?
- Is the material world good or evil?

The church needed to define orthodoxy. But they would do it without Jewish teachers, using Greek philosophical categories, in a context where Gnostic assumptions were already deeply embedded in the culture.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Constantine legalized Christianity but did not make it the official religion. Why does this distinction matter? What changed when Christianity went from persecuted minority to imperial favor?

2. During persecution, the church focused on survival and essentials. When persecution ended and masses of converts flooded in, Gnostic questions returned. What does this tell us about the relationship between cultural pressure and theological clarity?

## Part 2: A Different Model — The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15)

Before we examine the great councils of the fourth and fifth centuries, we need to ask: Was there ever a different way? Did the early church have a model for resolving theological disputes that aimed at unity rather than precision?

There was. And we find it in the Jerusalem Council.

### The Crisis (Acts 15:1-5)
Some believers from Judea came to Antioch teaching: "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved." This was not a minor dispute—it struck at the heart of the gospel. Paul and Barnabas had "no small dissension and debate" with them.

**The Question:** Must Gentiles become Jews to follow Jesus?

This was every bit as theologically significant as the later creedal controversies. It touched on:
- The nature of salvation (by grace or by works of the law?)
- The identity of God's people (ethnic Israel or a new multinational community?)
- The authority of Torah (binding on all believers or fulfilled in Christ?)
- The relationship between Jew and Gentile (equal or hierarchical?)

### The Method (Acts 15:6-21)

**Peter's Argument (15:7-11):**
Peter didn't offer a philosophical definition. He told a story: "God chose me to bring the gospel to the Gentiles. He gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us. He made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith."

Then his conclusion: "Why put a yoke on their necks that neither we nor our ancestors could bear? We believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will."

**James's Ruling (15:13-21):**
James quoted the prophet Amos (9:11-12) and made a practical ruling. Notice what he did NOT do:
- He did not define the metaphysical relationship between law and grace
- He did not create a formula for the nature of salvation
- He did not demand that everyone use the same theological vocabulary
- He did not excommunicate those who disagreed

Instead, he said: "We should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God, but we should write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from fornication, from whatever has been strangled, and from blood" (15:19-20).

### The Letter (Acts 15:23-29)

> The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the believers of Gentile origin in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. Since we have heard that certain persons who have gone out from us, though with no instructions from us, have said things to disturb you and have unsettled your minds, we have decided unanimously to choose representatives and send them to you... For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you **no further burden** than these essentials: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.

**"No Further Burden"** — This is the key phrase. The Jerusalem Council sought the *minimum* requirements for communion, not the *maximum* precision of definition.

### The Jerusalem Standard

The Jerusalem Council established a pattern for resolving disputes:

| Characteristic | How Jerusalem Council Operated |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Language** | Hebrew/Aramaic thought patterns, Scripture quotations |
| **Leaders** | Jewish apostles who knew Jesus |
| **Method** | Story, Scripture, experience of the Spirit |
| **Goal** | "No further burden" — minimize requirements for fellowship |
| **Result** | Unity in diversity — both Jews and Gentiles worship together |
| **Dissenters** | Addressed pastorally, not condemned |
| **Test of Fellowship** | Practical: avoid idolatry, sexual immorality |

**The Spirit's Role:**
Notice the remarkable claim in verse 28: "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us." This was not political maneuvering or philosophical debate. They discerned the Spirit's work through:
- Peter's testimony of God giving the Spirit to Gentiles
- Paul and Barnabas's reports of signs and wonders among Gentiles
- Scripture confirming what God was doing
- Consensus among the apostles and elders

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Jerusalem Council sought the *minimum* requirements for fellowship. Why this approach? What would have happened if they had demanded Gentiles be circumcised and keep all Torah?

2. Peter argued from experience ("God gave them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us") rather than from philosophical definition. Why is this significant? What does it tell us about how theology should be done?

3. The Jerusalem letter says "it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" — a remarkable claim of Spirit-led consensus. How did they discern the Spirit's leading? What's the difference between Spirit-led unity and politically-enforced uniformity?

4. James's ruling included practical requirements (avoid idol meat, sexual immorality, blood) but no theological formulas. Why might practical requirements preserve unity better than doctrinal tests?

---

## Part 3: The Great Councils — A Different Path

Three centuries after the Jerusalem Council, the church faced new crises requiring theological decisions. But by this time, the Jewish teachers were gone. The councils would take a very different approach.

### Council of Nicaea (AD 325) - The Nature of Christ

**The Question:** Is Jesus fully God, or is he a created being?

**The Controversy:**
- **Arius** argued Jesus was the highest of all created beings but not co-eternal with the Father
  - "There was a time when he was not"
  - Jesus was divine but not fully God
- **Athanasius** argued Jesus was "of the same substance" (*homoousios*) as the Father
  - Fully God, co-eternal with the Father
  - Not created but begotten

**The Decision:**
The Council of Nicaea sided with Athanasius and produced the Nicene Creed. Here is the full text (Nicene-Constantinopolitan form, AD 381), with Greek philosophical terms in bold:

> We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.
>
> And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only **[*monogenēs*]** Son of God, **begotten** **[*gennēthenta*]** of the Father before all ages, Light from Light, true God from true God, **begotten** not made, **of one Being [*homoousios*]** with the Father; through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.
>
> And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

**Greek Philosophical Terms Not Found in Scripture:**

| Term | Greek | Meaning | Origin |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| *homoousios* | ὁμοούσιος | "of the same substance/essence" | Coined from Greek *ousia* (being/substance)—a term from Aristotelian metaphysics. Ironically, this word was previously used by Gnostics and was initially rejected by some bishops as too philosophical. |
| *ousia* | οὐσία | "substance, essence, being" | Aristotle's *Metaphysics* uses this term to discuss what something fundamentally *is*. The Bible never asks "what is God made of?" |
| *hypostasis* | ὑπόστασις | "subsistence, underlying reality" | Used differently by different councils. Originally meant "substance" (same as *ousia*), later distinguished to mean "person." Platonic/Stoic philosophical terminology. |
| "begotten not made" | γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα | eternal generation | Addresses the metaphysical question of *how* the Son relates to the Father—a question foreign to Hebrew thought, which would simply say "The LORD and his Anointed" (Psalm 2). |
| "Light from Light" | φῶς ἐκ φωτός | emanation metaphor | Neoplatonic imagery of divine emanation, where lower realities "flow" from higher ones. |
| "true God from true God" | θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἐκ θεοῦ ἀληθινοῦ | essence identity | Essence language—defining Jesus by *what he is made of* rather than *who he is in relation to Israel*. |

**What the Bible Actually Says:**
Compare the creed's philosophical precision to how Scripture speaks of Jesus:
- "You are my Son; today I have begotten you" (Psalm 2:7) — relational, covenantal
- "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14) — incarnational, embodied
- "He is the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15) — functional, revelatory
- "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself" (2 Corinthians 5:19) — missional, salvific

Scripture asks: "Who is Jesus and what has he done?" The creeds ask: "What is Jesus's metaphysical composition?"

**The Gnostic Shadow:**
Notice what's happening: The church is defining Jesus's identity using Greek philosophical categories (substance, essence, being) rather than Hebrew relational categories. The question "What is Jesus made of?" would have sounded strange to first-century Jewish believers who knew him as Messiah, Son of Man, suffering servant.

Without Jewish teachers to say, "You're asking the wrong question," the church debated endlessly about *ousia* (substance) and *hypostasis* (subsistence). These were the very categories Gnosticism used to distinguish spirit from matter.

**The Power of the Creed to Divide:**
The Nicene Creed did not settle the matter—it fractured the church:

| Group | Position | Status Today |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Nicene Christians** | *Homoousios* (same substance) | Became "orthodox" Christianity |
| **Arians** | *Heteroousios* (different substance) | Condemned as heretics; Arian churches persecuted and eventually eliminated |
| **Semi-Arians** | *Homoiousios* (similar substance) | Caught in the middle; eventually absorbed or condemned |
| **Anomoeans** | Unlike the Father in every way | Extreme Arians; condemned |

The difference between *homoousios* (same substance) and *homoiousios* (similar substance) is a single Greek letter: iota. Over this one letter, Christians excommunicated each other, emperors exiled bishops, and communities were torn apart. Edward Gibbon famously remarked that the Roman Empire was convulsed over a diphthong.

**Who Was Lost:**
- Arian Christianity was widespread among Germanic tribes (Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Burgundians) for centuries
- Ulfilas, the apostle to the Goths, was Arian—he translated the Bible into Gothic
- When "orthodox" Christianity triumphed, Arian texts were destroyed, Arian bishops deposed, Arian churches closed
- An entire branch of Christianity was erased from history over a philosophical formula

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Council of Nicaea used the Greek word *homoousios* ("of the same substance") to define Christ's relationship to the Father. Why was philosophical precision necessary? What might have been lost in translating Jewish categories into Greek philosophy?

2. The text argues that the councils were "fighting heresy using the same philosophical categories that produced the heresy." What does this mean? Can you fight Gnosticism while using Gnostic categories?

3. Gnosticism taught that matter is evil and spirit is good. How might this assumption have influenced the debates about Christ's nature? What would a fully Jewish (non-Gnostic) Christology look like?

### Council of Constantinople (AD 381) - The Holy Spirit

**The Question:** Is the Holy Spirit fully God, or a created force?

**The Decision:**
The council expanded the Nicene Creed to affirm the full divinity of the Holy Spirit:
> "We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified..."

**The Problem:**
The phrase "and the Son" (*filioque* in Latin) was added by Western churches later. The East never accepted this addition. This single word would eventually contribute to the Great Schism of 1054.

### Council of Ephesus (AD 431) - Mary as Theotokos

**The Question:** Can Mary be called "Mother of God" (*Theotokos*) or only "Mother of Christ" (*Christotokos*)?

**The Controversy:**
- **Nestorius** argued for "Mother of Christ" to preserve the distinction between Jesus's divine and human natures
- **Cyril of Alexandria** argued for "Mother of God" to affirm that Jesus was one person, not two separate beings in proximity

**The Decision:**
The council sided with Cyril. Mary is *Theotokos* (God-bearer) because Jesus is one person—fully God and fully human, not two persons sharing a body.

**The Power of the Creed to Divide:**
Nestorius was condemned as a heretic and exiled. But his followers did not disappear:

| Group | Position | Continuing Communities |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **Ephesian Christians** | Mary is *Theotokos* (God-bearer) | Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, later Protestant |
| **Nestorian Christians** | Mary is *Christotokos* (Christ-bearer) | **Church of the East** (Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian Christianity) |

**Who Was Separated:**
- The Church of the East (often called "Nestorian," though they reject the label) became a separate communion
- They spread Christianity across Persia, Central Asia, India, and China—reaching as far as Tang Dynasty China by AD 635
- The Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, and the Chaldean Catholic Church descend from this tradition
- Today: approximately 500,000 members worldwide, mostly Iraqi and Iranian Christians
- Separated for 1,600 years over the title of Mary—a dispute rooted in Greek philosophical categories about natures and persons

**The Gnostic Shadow:**
Nestorius's fear of calling Mary "Mother of God" reveals Gnostic assumptions: if God is pure spirit and matter is corrupt, how could God truly become human? How could divinity touch humanity without being contaminated? The very fact that this was controversial shows how far the church had drifted from Jewish categories.

A first-century Jew would have had no problem with this. "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14). God tabernacled in Mary's womb just as he tabernacled in the wilderness. The Incarnation is scandalous precisely because God embraces the material world he created "very good."

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Nestorius was condemned as a heretic for being uncomfortable calling Mary "Mother of God." The text suggests his discomfort reveals Gnostic assumptions about spirit and matter. Do you agree? What does the Incarnation ("the Word became flesh") say about the material world?

2. The text says the Incarnation is "scandalous precisely because God embraces the material world he created 'very good.'" How does this challenge Gnostic thinking? How does it challenge modern evangelical spirituality that often treats the physical world as less important than the spiritual?

### Council of Chalcedon (AD 451) - Two Natures United

**The Question:** How can Jesus be fully God and fully human?

**The Decision:**
The Chalcedonian Definition declared that Christ is:
- One person (*hypostasis*)
- Two natures (divine and human)
- "Without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"
- The distinction of natures is preserved in the union

**The Full Text:**
> Following the holy Fathers, we all with one voice teach the confession of one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: the same **perfect [*teleion*]** in **divinity [*theotētos*]** and **perfect [*teleion*]** in **humanity [*anthrōpotētos*]**, the same truly God and truly man, of a **rational soul [*psychēs logikēs*]** and a body; **consubstantial [*homoousion*]** with the Father as regards his **divinity [*theotēta*]**, and the same **consubstantial [*homoousion*]** with us as regards his **humanity [*anthrōpotēta*]**; like us in all respects except for sin; begotten before the ages from the Father as regards his divinity, and in the last days the same for us and for our salvation from Mary, the virgin **God-bearer [*theotokos*]**, as regards his humanity;
>
> one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, acknowledged in two **natures [*physesin*]** which undergo no confusion, no change, no separation, no division; at no point was the difference between the **natures [*physeōn*]** taken away through the union, but rather the property of both **natures [*physeōs*]** is preserved and comes together into a single **person [*prosōpon*]** and a single **subsistent being [*hypostasin*]**; he is not parted or divided into two **persons [*prosōpa*]**, but is one and the same only-begotten Son, God, Word, Lord Jesus Christ...

**Greek Philosophical Terms Not Found in Scripture:**

| Term | Greek | Meaning | Philosophical Origin |
|------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| *physis* (nature) | φύσις | "nature, essence, constitution" | Aristotle's concept of what makes something the kind of thing it is. Used 14 times in the Definition. The Bible never discusses Jesus's "natures." |
| *hypostasis* (subsistence) | ὑπόστασις | "underlying reality, person" | Technical term from Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy meaning the concrete individual existence of something. |
| *prosōpon* (person) | πρόσωπον | "face, mask, person" | Originally meant a theatrical mask; evolved to mean "person" in philosophical discourse. |
| *homoousion* (consubstantial) | ὁμοούσιον | "of the same substance" | Same Nicene term applied now to Christ's humanity as well as divinity. |
| *teleion* (perfect/complete) | τέλειον | "complete, perfect, fully realized" | Aristotelian concept of something reaching its full *telos* (purpose/end). |
| "rational soul" | ψυχῆς λογικῆς | "soul possessing reason" | Platonic anthropology distinguishing rational soul from animal soul. Hebrew *nephesh* has no such division. |
| The Four Negatives | ἀσυγχύτως, ἀτρέπτως, ἀδιαιρέτως, ἀχωρίστως | "without confusion, change, division, separation" | Apophatic (negative) theology—defining by what something is *not*. A distinctly Greek philosophical method. Hebrew thought defines by story and action, not by negation. |

**The Apophatic Method:**
Notice the four negatives: *without* confusion, *without* change, *without* division, *without* separation. This is apophatic theology—defining something by stating what it is not. This method comes directly from Greek philosophy (especially Neoplatonism), where the ultimate reality is so transcendent it can only be described by negation.

Hebrew Scripture, by contrast, defines God through narrative action: "I am the LORD your God who brought you out of Egypt" (Exodus 20:2). God is known by what he *does*, not by what he metaphysically is *not*.

**What Was Gained:**
The Chalcedonian formula protected against:
- Arianism (Jesus is not fully God)
- Docetism (Jesus only seemed human)
- Nestorianism (Jesus is two separate persons)
- Eutychianism (Jesus's divine and human natures merged into one new thing)

**What Was Lost:**
But notice: We're still working in Greek philosophical categories (nature, substance, person, essence). We're trying to define mystery using precise metaphysical language. This is Hellenistic methodology, not Hebrew methodology.

A Jewish approach would say: "Jesus is the Word made flesh. He is Immanuel, God with us. He is the fullness of deity dwelling bodily. He sat down at wells and got hungry and died and rose again. This is who Messiah is. Now follow him."

Instead, we created a formula that protected orthodoxy but required a philosophical education to understand.

### Contrasting the Two Approaches

Now let's compare the Jerusalem Council with the later ecumenical councils:

| Aspect | Jerusalem Council (AD 49) | Nicaea/Chalcedon (4th-5th centuries) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Language** | Hebrew/Aramaic thought, Scripture | Greek philosophical categories |
| **Leaders** | Jewish apostles who knew Jesus | Gentile bishops educated in Greek philosophy |
| **Method** | Story, Scripture, Spirit's testimony | Metaphysical definition, philosophical precision |
| **Goal** | "No further burden" — minimize requirements | Maximize precision — detailed formulas |
| **Result** | Unity in diversity preserved | Uniformity demanded, diversity condemned |
| **Dissenters** | Addressed pastorally | Condemned, exiled, excommunicated |
| **Test of Fellowship** | Practical: avoid idolatry, sexual immorality | Intellectual: affirm correct formula |
| **Question Asked** | "How can we worship together?" | "What is the precise metaphysical definition?" |
| **Outcome** | Church stayed together | Church fractured into separate communions |

**The Key Difference:**
The Jerusalem Council asked: "What is the *minimum* we need to agree on to have fellowship?"
The later councils asked: "What is the *maximum* precision we can achieve in defining mystery?"

One approach creates space for unity. The other creates barriers to communion.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Jerusalem Council used stories and Scripture; the later councils used Greek philosophical terms. Why does this methodological difference matter? Can you fight Gnosticism while using Gnostic categories?

2. The Chalcedonian Definition says Jesus is "one person, two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." Can you explain what this means? If you can't, does that reveal a problem with requiring philosophical formulas for orthodoxy?

3. What was gained by the creeds? They protected against heresies. But what was lost? Arian, Nestorian, and Oriental Orthodox Christians were separated from communion. Was the trade-off worth it?

4. The creeds are considered foundational to orthodox Christianity. But if they were formulated using Greek categories, without Jewish teachers, in a context already influenced by Gnosticism, do we need to deconstruct them? Can we affirm what they protect while questioning how they were formulated?

---

## Part 4: Abandoning the Jerusalem Standard

The Jerusalem Council said: "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you **no further burden**."

The later councils imposed many burdens. And with each burden, the church fractured.

### From Fellowship to Formulas

The Jerusalem Council established minimum requirements for table fellowship:
- Avoid idolatry
- Avoid sexual immorality
- Avoid blood (dietary practice that enabled Jews and Gentiles to eat together)

Notice: these are *practical* requirements. You can observe whether someone practices idolatry or sexual immorality. You can share a meal together.

The later councils established *intellectual* requirements for communion:
- Affirm that Christ is *homoousios* (of the same substance) with the Father
- Confess one *hypostasis* (subsistence) in two *physeis* (natures)
- Accept Mary as *Theotokos* (God-bearer)

Notice: these are *philosophical* requirements. You need theological education to understand them. You cannot observe *homoousios*—you must confess it as an intellectual proposition.

**What Changed:**
The test of fellowship shifted from orthopraxy (right practice) to orthodoxy (right belief about metaphysical definitions).

### From "No Further Burden" to Maximum Precision

| Jerusalem Council | Later Councils |
|------------------|----------------|
| "No further burden than these essentials" | Increasingly detailed formulas required |
| Practical requirements (avoid idolatry, immorality) | Philosophical propositions (affirm *homoousios*, confess two natures) |
| Unity in diversity — Jews and Gentiles worship together | Uniformity demanded — one precise formula for all |
| Pastoral approach to dissenters | Condemnation, exile, excommunication of dissenters |

**The Irony:**
The Jerusalem Council faced a dispute that could have split the church permanently (circumcision and Torah observance for Gentiles). They resolved it by minimizing requirements.

The later councils faced disputes that could have been resolved with humility and diverse terminology. They escalated them by maximizing precision and condemning those who used different vocabulary.

### From Spirit-Led Consensus to Political Power

**Jerusalem Council:**
- "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us"
- Discerned through testimony, Scripture, signs of the Spirit among Gentiles
- Consensus among apostles and elders
- No coercion, no imperial enforcement

**Later Councils:**
- Convened by emperors (Constantine at Nicaea, Theodosius at Constantinople, etc.)
- Bishops who disagreed faced exile by imperial decree
- Arian bishops deposed by force
- Nestorian churches separated by political power
- The "orthodox" position was often determined by which faction had the emperor's support

**The Question:**
When councils relied on imperial power to enforce their decisions, could they still claim "it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us"? Or had they become instruments of political unity rather than spiritual discernment?

### From Orthopraxy to Orthodoxy

**Before the Councils:**
During persecution, Christianity was defined by practice:
- How do we follow Jesus's teachings?
- How do we love our enemies (including our persecutors)?
- How do we care for the poor and vulnerable?
- How do we live as a subversive community under empire?

**After the Councils:**
After Constantine, Christianity was defined by belief:
- Do you affirm the *homoousios*?
- Do you confess the hypostatic union?
- Do you accept Chalcedonian Christology?

**The Tragic Consequence:**
You could be "orthodox" (affirm the creeds) while living in blatant contradiction to Jesus's teachings:
- Bishops who confessed Christ's divinity but lived in imperial luxury
- "Orthodox" Christians who owned slaves, waged war, persecuted Jews
- Theological precision without transformation of life

**The Lost Connection:**
In Torah, belief and practice were inseparable. To "know" God meant to do justice, love mercy, walk humbly (Micah 6:8). Orthodoxy *was* orthopraxy.

The church lost this connection. We created a Christianity where you could believe all the right things about Jesus while ignoring everything he taught about how to live.

### What If They Had Followed Jerusalem?

Imagine if the councils had followed the Jerusalem model:

**Instead of:**
"We declare that Christ is *homoousios* with the Father. Those who say otherwise are anathema."

**They could have said:**
"We confess that Jesus is Lord, fully God and fully human, the one through whom God reconciles the world to himself. We acknowledge that our brothers and sisters in other regions use different language to confess this same faith. It seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden than this: confess Jesus as Lord and live according to his teachings."

**The Result:**
- Arians, Nestorians, and Miaphysites might have remained in communion
- Diversity of expression within unity of faith
- Fellowship based on shared practice and confession of Jesus, not philosophical precision
- The church might not have fractured into permanently separated communions

We cannot know for certain. But the Jerusalem Council stands as a witness that another way was possible.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Jerusalem Council required practical obedience (avoid idolatry, immorality); later councils required intellectual assent to philosophical propositions. Why does this shift matter? Which approach better reflects the way of Jesus?

2. The text argues you could be "orthodox" while ignoring Jesus's teachings. Can you think of examples? How do we guard against believing the right things while living the wrong way?

3. Torah linked belief and practice inseparably. How might recovering this connection change our understanding of orthodoxy? What would it look like for orthodoxy to be orthopraxy?

4. What if the councils had said: "Confess Jesus as Lord; live according to his teachings. Beyond this, we impose no further burden"? Would this have preserved unity? Or does protecting truth require precise definitions?

---

## Part 5: The Fracturing Continues

Once the church chose precision over unity, the fracturing became inevitable. Each council created new divisions. Each division remains unhealed to this day.

### The Pattern Repeats: Chalcedon Splits the Church

Not everyone accepted Chalcedon's formula. And rather than seeking the minimum requirements for fellowship, the church chose to separate over philosophical vocabulary.

| Tradition | Position on Christ's Nature | Member Churches | Approximate Members Today |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Chalcedonian** | Two natures (divine and human) in one person | Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant | ~2.4 billion |
| **Oriental Orthodox** | One united nature (*miaphysis*) after the union | Coptic, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Syriac, Armenian, Malankara | ~60 million |
| **Church of the East** | Two natures, two *qnome* (distinct) | Assyrian, Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean | ~500,000 |

**Oriental Orthodox Churches** (rejected Chalcedon as "Nestorian"):
- **Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria** — Egypt (~15-20 million)
- **Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church** — Ethiopia (~45 million, largest Oriental Orthodox body)
- **Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church** — Eritrea (~2.5 million)
- **Syriac Orthodox Church** — Middle East, India (~3-4 million)
- **Armenian Apostolic Church** — Armenia, diaspora (~9 million)
- **Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church** — India (~2.5 million)

**Chalcedonian Churches** (accepted Chalcedon):
- Roman Catholic Church
- Eastern Orthodox Churches (Greek, Russian, Serbian, Romanian, etc.)
- Later, Protestant churches

**The Tragedy of Miaphysitism:**
The Oriental Orthodox churches are often wrongly called "Monophysite" (one nature), implying they believe Jesus was only divine. In fact, they confess *miaphysis*—one *united* nature that is fully divine and fully human. Their disagreement with Chalcedon may be more linguistic than substantive.

In 1990, Pope John Paul II and Coptic Pope Shenouda III signed a common declaration affirming they hold the same faith about Christ. Similar agreements exist between Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches. After 1,500 years, theologians now suggest they were saying the same thing in different Greek philosophical vocabularies.

**Let That Sink In:**
After 1,500 years of separation—different liturgies, different leadership, different theological traditions—the theologians conclude: "We believe the same thing. We just use different Greek words."

Sixty million Oriental Orthodox Christians. Separated from communion for fifteen centuries. Over vocabulary.

**The Jerusalem Standard Violated:**
Imagine the Jerusalem Council facing this dispute:
- James would ask: "Do both groups confess Jesus as Lord, fully God and fully human?"
- Both would say: "Yes!"
- James would say: "Then why are you separated? It seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden. Use whatever language helps you confess this truth. Worship together."

But that's not what happened. Instead:
- Precise philosophical formulas were required
- Those who used different vocabulary were condemned
- Churches that confessed the same faith were separated
- The division remains unhealed

**The Question That Haunts:**
If the Jerusalem Council could preserve unity between circumcised Jews and uncircumcised Gentiles—a far more radical cultural divide—why couldn't the later councils preserve unity between Chalcedonian and Miaphysite Christians who confessed the same Lord?

The answer: They chose precision over unity. They chose Greek philosophy over Hebrew wisdom. They chose formulas over fellowship.

### The Great East-West Schism (AD 1054) — The Pattern Continues

The church had already fractured over Arianism, Nestorianism, and Miaphysitism. Now it would fracture again—this time over methodology itself.

**Different Cultures, Different Methods:**
- **The West** (Latin, Roman): Preserved truth through *words* (doctrine, creeds, definitions)
- **The East** (Greek, Byzantine): Preserved truth through *images* (icons, liturgy, beauty)

Both methods are valuable. Both can preserve truth. But rather than honoring diversity, each accused the other of idolatry.

**The Iconoclastic Controversy (8th-9th centuries):**
Byzantine Emperor Leo III ordered destruction of icons. The controversy raged:
- **Iconoclasts** said icons violated the prohibition against graven images (Exodus 20:4)
- **Iconodules** said the Incarnation changed everything—if God took on flesh, matter can bear divine presence

The Second Council of Nicaea (787) affirmed icons, distinguishing between *latria* (worship for God alone) and *proskynesis* (veneration offered to icons).

**The Western Critique:**
To Western eyes, venerating icons looked like idolatry. The sophisticated Eastern theology didn't compute within Western categories.

**The Eastern Counter-Critique:**
But couldn't the West be accused of "doctrinal idolatry"? If venerating an icon can become idolatry, couldn't venerating a doctrine become idolatry too? You can worship your theological system instead of the God it describes.

**The Accumulated Disputes:**
- The *filioque* controversy (does the Spirit proceed from Father alone, or Father "and Son"?)
- Papal authority (is the Pope supreme, or first among equals?)
- Liturgical differences (unleavened vs. leavened bread, married vs. celibate clergy)
- Icons (veneration vs. prohibition)

**The Final Break (1054):**
Cardinal Humbert placed a bull of excommunication on the altar of Hagia Sophia. Patriarch Michael Cerularius responded with his own excommunication. The Great Schism divided Christendom into Catholic West and Orthodox East.

The mutual excommunications were not lifted until 1965—**911 years later**. Full communion was never restored. The wound is still open.

**The Jerusalem Standard Violated—Again:**
Imagine if the church had followed the Jerusalem model:
- "The West preserves truth through creeds; the East through icons. Both confess Jesus as Lord. It seems good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden. Let each region worship according to its culture."
- "Some say the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone; others say from Father and Son. Both confess the Spirit is Lord and giver of life. We impose no further burden."
- "Some use leavened bread; others unleavened. Some ordain married priests; others require celibacy. These are matters of custom, not communion-breaking issues."

But that's not what happened. Instead:
- Unity in diversity was rejected
- Uniformity was demanded
- One iota of theology (*filioque*) became grounds for schism
- The church split in two over matters the Jerusalem Council would have called "no further burden"

**A Billion People Separated:**
Today:
- Eastern Orthodox: ~220 million
- Roman Catholic: ~1.3 billion
- Not in communion with each other
- Over disputes that could have been handled with Jerusalem-Council wisdom

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. After 1,500 years, theologians discovered that Chalcedonian and Oriental Orthodox Christians "believe the same thing in different words." Sixty million people separated for fifteen centuries over vocabulary. What does this tell us about requiring precise philosophical formulas for communion?

2. The text imagines James at the Jerusalem Council saying: "Do both groups confess Jesus as Lord, fully God and fully human? Then why are you separated?" Why didn't the later councils take this approach? What was gained by demanding precision? What was lost?

3. The East preserved truth through icons; the West through doctrines. Each accused the other of idolatry. Can both be partially right? How do we guard against both "icon idolatry" and "doctrinal idolatry"?

4. The Great Schism of 1054 separated 1.5 billion Christians who are still not in communion over issues the Jerusalem Council would have called "no further burden" (different liturgies, married vs. celibate clergy, one word in the creed). Does this reveal a fundamental flaw in how the church handles disputes?

## Part 6: The Pattern Emerges

Now we can see the full pattern. Trace the line from Jerusalem Council to present fracture:

### The Timeline of Division

| Date | Event | What Happened | Result |
|------|-------|---------------|--------|
| **AD 49** | **Jerusalem Council** | Jewish apostles preserve unity in diversity: "No further burden" | Jews and Gentiles worship together |
| **AD 114-120** | **The Betrayal** | Gentile Christians betray Jewish family during Bar Kokhba revolt | Church loses Jewish teachers and Hebrew interpretive tradition |
| **2nd-3rd centuries** | **Gnostic Infiltration** | Without Jewish teachers, Gnostic ideas fill the vacuum | Spirit/matter dualism becomes assumed framework |
| **AD 313** | **Constantinian Shift** | Christianity legalized; flood of convenience converts | Gnostic questions return with force |
| **AD 325** | **Council of Nicaea** | First creedal council; Greek philosophical precision required | Arian churches condemned and eventually eliminated |
| **AD 431** | **Council of Ephesus** | Nestorius condemned over title of Mary | Church of the East separated (still separated today) |
| **AD 451** | **Council of Chalcedon** | Two natures formula imposed | Oriental Orthodox separated (60 million, still separated) |
| **AD 1054** | **Great Schism** | East and West excommunicate each other | Catholic and Orthodox split (still not in communion) |
| **AD 1517** | **Protestant Reformation** | (Next week) Western church fractures again | Thousands of Protestant denominations |

**Do You See the Pattern?**

The Jerusalem Council preserved unity. Every subsequent council created division.

### The Fork in the Road

At the Jerusalem Council, the church faced a choice between two approaches:

**Option 1: The Jerusalem Standard** (what they chose in Acts 15)
- Minimum requirements for fellowship
- Practical tests (orthopraxy)
- Unity in diversity
- Scripture and Spirit over philosophy
- "No further burden"

**Option 2: The Greek Standard** (what the later councils chose)
- Maximum precision in definition
- Intellectual tests (orthodoxy)
- Uniformity demanded
- Philosophy over practical wisdom
- "You must affirm this exact formula"

The church chose Option 1 in AD 49. It worked. Jews and Gentiles worshiped together despite profound cultural differences.

But when the Jewish teachers were lost, the church defaulted to Option 2. And the fracturing has never stopped.

### What Was Lost When We Abandoned the Jerusalem Standard

**1. Unity in Diversity**
- Jerusalem Council: "Circumcised Jews and uncircumcised Gentiles can worship together"
- Later Councils: "You must use our precise Greek vocabulary or you're out"

**2. Practical Over Philosophical**
- Jerusalem Council: "Avoid idolatry and sexual immorality" (observable behaviors)
- Later Councils: "Affirm *homoousios*" (requires philosophical education)

**3. Spirit-Led Consensus Over Imperial Power**
- Jerusalem Council: "It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us"
- Later Councils: Emperors convened councils, exiled dissenting bishops, enforced "orthodoxy" politically

**4. Humility Over Certainty**
- Jerusalem Council: "These few essentials are enough"
- Later Councils: "We have defined the mystery with precision; conform or be condemned"

**5. Fellowship Over Formulas**
- Jerusalem Council: "How can we eat together?" (table fellowship)
- Later Councils: "What is Christ's metaphysical composition?" (abstract definition)

### The Common Thread

Every division flows from the original schism. Without Jewish teachers:
- We lost the Text's original context
- We adopted Greek philosophical methods instead of Hebrew wisdom
- We emphasized orthodoxy over orthopraxy
- We created formulas that required philosophical education
- We divided over distinctions that would have seemed foreign to first-century believers
- We abandoned the Jerusalem standard of "no further burden"

**The Tragedy:**
The Jerusalem Council showed us how to preserve unity while addressing serious theological disputes. But we forgot their wisdom. Or perhaps: without Jewish teachers to remind us, we never learned it at all.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The Jerusalem Council preserved unity in diversity. Every subsequent council created division. Why? What was different about the Jerusalem approach?

2. The text argues that when the church lost its Jewish teachers, it abandoned the Jerusalem Standard and defaulted to Greek philosophical precision. Do you find this explanation convincing? What evidence supports or challenges this view?

3. The Jerusalem Council asked "How can we worship together?" The later councils asked "What is the precise metaphysical definition?" Which question is wiser? Is there a place for both questions, or does the second question inevitably undermine the first?

4. We've seen Christians separated for 1,500 years over vocabulary (Oriental Orthodox), 900+ years over one word in a creed (East-West Schism), and permanently over Arianism and Nestorianism. If we had followed the Jerusalem Standard of "no further burden," would these divisions have occurred? Or does protecting truth require the kind of precision that inevitably creates division?

5. Marcion wanted to reject the Hebrew Bible entirely. The church said no—but then functionally ignored the Old Testament and lost the Jerusalem Council's wisdom about how to handle disputes. Are we Marcionites in practice even if not in theory? How would recovering Hebrew wisdom change our theology?

6. Next week we'll look at the long-term consequences: Crusades, Inquisition, Holocaust. How do you think the theological developments we've discussed this week—especially the shift from orthopraxy to orthodoxy, and from unity-in-diversity to uniformity-or-condemnation—connect to those atrocities?

## For Next Week

Next week we explore the darkest chapters of Christian history: pogroms, Crusades, Inquisition, and the Holocaust. We'll see how theological anti-Semitism—rooted in the betrayal of AD 114-120 and reinforced by centuries of teaching—led to unimaginable violence.

But we'll also explore hope: how the Holocaust finally forced the church to confront its anti-Semitism, leading to Nostra Aetate (1965) and the beginning of Jewish-Christian dialogue. After 1,800 years of separation, the wound might finally begin to heal.

Come prepared to discuss: Can the church repent of corporate sin? What would it mean to take responsibility for atrocities committed by Christians centuries ago?
