# Week 1: The Betrayal and Its Consequences

## Church History as Preface to Deconstructing Systematic Theology

### Opening Question
If Christ was right at the doorstep in the first century—if the early church's radical obedience was working, if the Roman Empire was crumbling, if the Kingdom was breaking through—what happened that led us to where we are today?

## Part 1: Initial Unity (AD 30-100)

### The Jesus Movement as Jewish
The earliest followers of Jesus were entirely Jewish. Christianity was not a separate religion but a movement within Judaism, as distinctly Jewish as the Pharisees, Sadducees, or Essenes.

**Key Features:**
- **Synagogue-based**: Early believers continued attending synagogue, observing Torah
- **Gentile inclusion**: Gentiles were welcomed as God-fearers and proselytes, grafted into Israel's story
- **No distinction to Rome**: Roman authorities saw no difference between "Christians" and other Jews
- **Oral Torah**: Scripture was preserved in Jewish communities through memorization, rabbinic teaching
- **Unified witness**: Jewish and Gentile believers formed one community under Jewish leadership

### The Jewish Exception
Rome granted Jews a special exemption from emperor worship because their monotheism made it impossible to bow to Caesar. This came with a condition: don't aggressively spread your faith.

**The Protection:**
- Jewish communities extended this protection to Gentile converts
- "These believers worship our God—they are covered by our exemption"
- Shielded Gentiles from emperor worship requirements and associated taxes
- Every Gentile convert increased the danger to Jewish communities
- Jews knew they were violating Rome's terms and did it anyway
- **These Gentiles were family**

### Why Rome Responded
The Jesus movement was spreading rapidly. Gentiles by the thousands were:
- Abandoning emperor worship
- Refusing to pay taxes tied to imperial cult
- Declaring loyalty to a different King

If this "Christian Judaism" swept the empire, Rome would lose the taxes, loyalty, and worship that held the vast machine together. Rome decided to crush the movement by crushing its Jewish core.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Before this class, how did you understand the relationship between early Christianity and Judaism? How does this history challenge or confirm your previous understanding?

2. The "Jewish Exception" allowed Jews to refuse emperor worship. Why was extending this protection to Gentile converts so risky for Jewish communities? What does it tell us about their understanding of family?

## Part 2: The Betrayal (AD 100-135)

### The Trajan and Hadrian Persecutions
Under Emperors Trajan (98-117) and Hadrian (117-138), Rome intensified persecution of Jews. This culminated in the Bar Kochba revolt (132-136) and brutal Roman reprisals.

### The Moment of Choice
When Rome came hunting specifically for Jews, the Gentile believers faced a choice:
- Stand with their Jewish family who had protected them for decades
- Use their uncircumcised bodies as proof they weren't Jewish

### What They Did
The Gentile Christians, by and large, chose safety:

> "Are you here for the Jews? We are not Jewish. We have the foreskin to prove it. We follow Christ, not Moses. We are a different religion entirely."

They left their Jewish brothers and sisters to die.

### The Schism
In that moment of betrayal, Christianity separated from its Jewish roots. This was not a theological development or a natural parting of ways. It was an act of cowardice and self-preservation that created a rupture that has never healed.

**The Haunting Question:**
The early church believed their obedience was "speeding the coming" of the Day of the Lord (2 Peter 3:11-12). By the end of the first century, the Roman Empire was crumbling. Jesus's feet were at the door.

What if the Gentile betrayal slammed that door shut? What if the two thousand years of waiting since then are not evidence that the early Christians were wrong, but evidence that we derailed the redemptive arc of history?

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The betrayal happened around AD 114-120, yet most people date the "parting of the ways" much earlier (often to Paul's time). Why do you think the later dating matters? What changes if the schism was a moral failure rather than a theological necessity?

2. The early Gentile believers faced a choice: stand with their Jewish family at the cost of their own safety, or save themselves. How do you think you would have responded in their situation? What makes sacrificial solidarity difficult?

3. The text suggests the Gentile betrayal may have "slammed the door shut" on Jesus's imminent return. How does this challenge your understanding of eschatology? What does it mean if human obedience or disobedience affects divine timing?

4. When we betray someone, we often justify it by convincing ourselves they deserved it. How did the Gentile Christians' need to justify their betrayal lead to anti-Semitism? Where else do you see this pattern in Christian history or contemporary life?

## Part 3: Immediate Consequences—Gnosticism Fills the Gaps

### Loss of Connection to the Text
When Gentile Christians cut themselves off from Jewish teachers, they lost:
- **Walking libraries of Torah**: Jewish communities who had memorized Scripture
- **Rabbinic interpretation**: The methods for understanding Jesus's teachings
- **Jewish worldview**: The framework for reading Paul's letters
- **The Hebrew Bible**: What would become the "Old Testament" became foreign

This was nearly 1,000 years before the printing press. Scripture was preserved in oral tradition, carried in hearts and minds. The Gentile church suddenly had to be Christian without the very people who understood Christian Scripture.

### Gnosticism Rushes In
Into this vacuum came Gnosticism—a dualistic philosophy that was already circulating in the Greco-Roman world.

**Core Gnostic Beliefs:**
- **Matter is evil, spirit is good**: The material world is a prison, not God's good creation
- **Secret knowledge saves**: Salvation comes through special gnosis (knowledge), not faithfulness to covenant
- **The Creator God is evil**: The God of the Hebrew Bible (the "Demiurge") is a lesser, malevolent being
- **Jesus only seemed human**: He couldn't actually take on corrupt matter (Docetism)

**Why Gnosticism Appealed:**
Without Jewish teachers to anchor them in Genesis 1 ("God saw that it was very good"), Gentile Christians were vulnerable to Greek philosophical assumptions about matter being inferior to spirit. Gnosticism offered a framework that made sense to Hellenistic minds but contradicted the entire biblical narrative.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Gnosticism taught that matter is evil and spirit is good. How does this contradict Genesis 1:31 ("God saw all that he had made, and it was very good")? Where do you see Gnostic assumptions about the material world still influencing Christianity today?

### Marcion's Heresy
Marcion of Sinope (c. 85-160) took Gnostic ideas to their logical conclusion:
- **Rejected the Hebrew Bible entirely**: The God of the Old Testament was evil
- **Created his own canon**: Only a edited Gospel of Luke and ten edited letters of Paul
- **Created a different Jesus**: A savior who had nothing to do with the Jewish God

**The Church's Response:**
The church condemned Marcion as a heretic. His theology was formally rejected. His followers were excluded.

**The Tragedy:**
We rejected Marcion's theology but absorbed his methodology. How many Christians today:
- Neglect the Old Testament almost entirely?
- Skip from Genesis 3 to Matthew 1 as if nothing important happened in between?
- Gravitate to Paul because he seems clearer than Jesus?
- Struggle to see Jesus in the Hebrew Scriptures?

"You have made the Old Testament come alive!" people say when encountering BEMA. The comment reveals something tragic: for most Christians, the Old Testament was dead. We rejected Marcion's heresy with our lips but absorbed his methodology into our bones.

### Anti-Semitism Emerges
Within one or two generations of the apostles, church fathers' writings contain shocking anti-Semitism.

**Why?**
When Gentile Christians betrayed their Jewish family, they had to justify what they had done:
- Convince themselves Jews deserved to be abandoned
- Tell themselves a story where Jews were villains
- Reinterpret the crucifixion to blame "the Jews" (conveniently forgetting Jesus was Jewish)
- Project their guilt onto the people they had betrayed

The poison took root immediately and has never been fully purged.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. Marcion rejected the Hebrew Bible entirely, claiming its God was evil. The church condemned this as heresy. Yet how do we, in practice, often treat the Old Testament as less important or less relevant than the New? What Marcionite assumptions might we have absorbed without realizing it?

## Part 4: What We Lost

### The Text
Without Jewish teachers, Scripture became foreign. The Old Testament was functionally lost to most Christians. Even the New Testament became difficult to understand without its Jewish context.

### Community
The model of radical, inclusive community that welcomed Gentiles into Israel's story was replaced by Greco-Roman hierarchical structures and ethnic divisions.

### Discipleship
The rabbinic method of formation—disciples becoming like their teacher through total life immersion—was replaced by intellectual assent to doctrinal propositions.

### Wrestling
The Jewish culture of asking hard questions, arguing with the text, and trusting God through complexity was replaced by demand for certainty and quick answers.

### **DISCUSSION BREAK**

1. The text argues we lost four things: Text, Community, Discipleship, and Wrestling. Which of these losses do you feel most acutely in your own Christian experience? Why?

2. If the schism of AD 114-120 was the catastrophic event that derailed redemptive history, what would healing look like? Is reconciliation possible after 1,900 years?

3. The church survived without Jewish teachers for centuries, but at what cost? What might we need to recover or relearn from our Jewish roots?

4. How does this history prepare you for "deconstructing systematic theology"? What assumptions about Christian theology might need to be questioned if they emerged from a church already separated from its Jewish foundation?

## For Next Week

Next week we'll explore how the Gnostic crisis forced the church to respond with creeds and councils. We'll see how each attempt to define orthodoxy without Jewish input led to more divisions, more schisms, and the absorption of more Gnostic assumptions into what would become "orthodox" Christianity.

Come prepared to discuss: If the church was already separated from its Jewish teachers, how could the councils at Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon avoid integrating Gnostic presuppositions into their definitions of Christ?
