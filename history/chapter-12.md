# Chapter 12: Commissioned and Sent

We began this journey with a question: If Christ was right at the doorstep---if the early church's radical obedience was working, if the Empire was crumbling, if the Kingdom was breaking through---what happened that led us to where we are today?

We followed that question through twenty centuries. Through the catastrophic schism that severed Christianity from its Jewish roots. Through Constantine and Christendom. Through East-West division and Crusader violence. Through Reformation recovery and Enlightenment collision. Through American awakening and fundamentalist reaction. Through world wars that shattered humanistic optimism and academic revolutions that began healing ancient wounds.

We've diagnosed what was lost: Text, Community, Discipleship, Wrestling. We've glimpsed what might be recovered. We've faced honestly the failures of our tradition and the captivity that still holds us.

Now what?

This final chapter is different from the others. It's not analysis. It's not history. It's blessing. It's commissioning. It's sending.

Because you didn't read this book just to become more informed. You came here, whether you knew it or not, to be changed. To be equipped. To be sent.

## The Wilderness Journey

Come and stand at the threshold.

Behind you lies a trail of baggage---things you've shed along the way, things you didn't even know you were carrying until you put them down. Ahead lies unknown territory, unmarked paths, a future you cannot fully see.

You've been sorting through boxes. Some of this was handed to you by well-meaning teachers who were doing the best they knew. Some of it you packed yourself. All of it needed examining.

There's nothing romantic about this sorting. Some of what you unpacked was precious---treasures that will travel with you forever. Some of what you unpacked was painful---lies you believed, wounds you carried, frameworks that never actually worked.

Cynicism. Hypocrisy. Numbing techniques. Apologetics that convinced no one and damaged honest inquiry. Doctrinal statements wielded as weapons. Worldviews that protected privilege. Carefully constructed personas that hid your true self. Righteousness that was really self-righteousness. Secrets that festered in the dark.

Some of this you've left in neat piles by the roadside. Some of it you've flung off the wagon, glad to be rid of it.

And now you stand here, lighter than when you started. Different. Changed.

## Streams in the Desert

You didn't make this journey alone.

Along the way, there were people who handed you water. Teachers who asked the right questions. Authors who put words to what you were feeling. Fellow travelers who said "me too" when you thought you were crazy. Communities that welcomed your doubt when other communities demanded certainty.

These streams in the desert---the people who loved the gospel and loved you---they kept you alive. Remember them. Thank them. Become that stream for someone else.

The wilderness has a way of clarifying what matters. The things that seemed essential in Egypt often look different after years of desert wandering. Priorities shift. Definitions change. What you thought was the destination turns out to have been just a landmark along the way.

## The Other Side

Freedom and deliverance are waiting.

It won't look like the travel brochure. The promised land never does. It will be wilder, messier, more demanding than you imagined. But you'll love the wind. You'll love what the sun does to your skin, the weathering that marks you as someone who has actually lived. You'll love the song of the stars more than you ever loved the safety of sealed boxes and certain answers.

Here's the secret nobody tells you: once you've tasted this freedom, you won't want the old captivity back. Even when the wilderness is hard---and it will be hard---you won't romanticize Egypt. The bread of anxious slaves won't compare to the manna of liberated wanderers.

And here's the deeper secret: there will always be another journey ahead. Another threshold. Another betwixt-and-between. The wilderness isn't a detour on the way to settled life. The wilderness is how God works. It's where transformation happens.

Part of you will look forward to those nights alone on the prairie when God's voice sings clear and uncluttered. Because you're not settling in. You're a pioneer. An explorer. An adventurer.

Carry on.

## The Benediction

So let this be spoken over you:

May you have bravery. May you have guts. May you have honesty when honesty is costly and discernment when the path is unclear.

May you remember that God is not threatened by you---not by your questions, your failures, your wrestling, your growth. "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear" (1 John 4:18, NIV), and the One who made you is not afraid of who you are becoming.

May you know Jesus deeply, intimately---not as a theological concept but as a living presence. May you fall into step with the man from Nazareth, walking where he walks, loving what he loves, seeing what he sees.

May the Bible capture your imagination and your heart again. If Scripture has been used against you, if it has been weaponized to wound rather than wielded to heal, may that abuse be mended. May you discover the Text that lives, the Word that transforms, the Spirit-sword that cuts through everything false to set you free.

May you find your place in the church---not a perfect church, for there is no such thing, but a community where you are known and loved and needed. You belong. You are a member of the body. The body is incomplete without you.

May you create what you're craving. If the community you need doesn't exist, build it. You're not alone in your longing. Others are waiting for someone to go first.

May you be authentic, real, unmasked. May you shed the personas that protected you but also imprisoned you. May you embrace your place in the Kingdom of God---a Kingdom that is already here, already breaking through, already making all things new.

May you remember you're part of a big, glorious story. A story that began before you and will continue after you but needs you in this chapter. This moment in the story requires your particular gifts, your particular witness, your particular presence.

May you experience the active, intimate leading of the Holy Spirit. May you bear the fruit of that Spirit: "love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control" (Galatians 5:22-23, NIV). May your life become evidence that God is real.

May your hunger and thirst for righteousness be honored, not suppressed. May your heart be broken by what breaks God's heart. May your anger be awakened by what angers the prophets. Righteous discontent is a gift.

May you be a learner, a listener, a humble worker. May you lift your head from despair to find family---people walking the same direction, carrying the same hope, serving the same King.

Remember: You belong here. There is room for you. The Kingdom has space that only you can fill.

May you find the holy in daily life. May you wake up to the life that's happening now, not the life you're waiting for. May your journey unfold into the unknown with wonder rather than fear.

Beloved, in the mighty and powerful name of Jesus. Amen.

## The Commissioning

Now come and stand at the water's edge. Stand on your own two feet.

In the mighty and powerful name of Jesus:

You are commissioned for the work of the gospel. You are commissioned as a minister of Jesus Christ. You are commissioned to live as an ambassador of the Kingdom---in the work of healing, serving, loving, and reconciliation. You are commissioned as an emissary of justice. You are commissioned to put things right, to call things that are not as they shall be, to participate in the restoration of all things.

This is not metaphor. This is not poetry. This is vocation.

So stop waiting.

Stop waiting for someone else to say you count. Stop waiting for someone else to say you matter. Stop waiting for someone else to say you have worth. Stop waiting for someone else to say you have a voice. Stop waiting for someone else to say you have a place. Stop waiting for someone else to say you are called.

You are.

The One who knit you together in your mother's womb---"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb" (Psalm 139:13, NIV)---has been singing over you from the beginning: You are chosen. You are valuable. You are loved.

Not because of your gender or your vocation or your marital status. Not because of the labels others have given you or the books that have shaped you or your accomplishments. Not because of your correct doctrine or your perfect theology. In Christ, you have value beyond all that. You abide in love. You can rest in your God-breathed worth.

God has called you by name---"I have summoned you by name; you are mine" (Isaiah 43:1, NIV). God has written your name on the palm of his hands: "See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands" (Isaiah 49:16, NIV). You are knit together, loved, and rescued already.

So go.

You know Jesus. You've experienced power and grace. Now go and heal, disciple, minister, love. Loosen chains and throw open doors. Speak and breathe and prophesy. Get behind whatever pulpit is yours---the boardroom, the classroom, the kitchen, the studio, the jobsite, the neighborhood. Organize, rabble-rouse, or find transcendence in the laundry pile while you pray in obscurity.

Work the love out and in and around you. However God made you and placed you to do it---just do it. Don't let lies fence you in or hold you back.

Love your spouse, your children, the poor, the orphan, the widow. Love the powerful and the broken. Love the hurting, your friends, yourself, your enemies. Love until you love the whole world. Love into the fullness of the image-bearer God created you to be.

Just that. No more. But certainly no less.

## You Are Not Alone

Listen: there's a bonfire burning in the open air.

We've been waiting for you.

Lots of us. Out here in the wilderness, beyond the walls of restricted religion, past the boundaries of what was permitted. We're here. We've been here. We've been ministering and preaching and praying and teaching and loving and walking each other home. It's glorious and messy. It's nothing like the brochure. It's better.

We are the people of God. We are family. Your family.

You are not starting from scratch. You are not pioneering alone. You are joining a movement that has been building for two thousand years---longer if you count our Jewish roots, which we must. The communion of saints stretches backward through time and forward into eternity. You step into a story already in motion.

So come. Find your people. Take your place at the fire. Share your story and hear theirs. Let the warmth reach your bones.

We've been waiting for you.

## The Sending

Now turn around and face your life. Look it in the eye.

Because this, right now, this is it.

Not someday when you have more training. Not someday when you feel ready. Not someday when someone grants you permission. Now. Here. This life. These circumstances. These people. This moment.

You are surrounded by jelly-faced toddlers or thousands of souls. You are in a hospital or a back alley or a church building or an orphanage or a suburban kitchen. You are giving voice to dozens or only one other soul. It doesn't matter. You are a minister.

Your ministry begins now.

And truth be told, it began long ago. You've been doing this work without naming it. You've been loving people into the Kingdom without realizing that's what it was. You've been participating in redemption your whole life.

Now it's conscious. Now it's commissioned. Now it's named.

You have been sent out to the very spot where you are right now. This is not an accident. This is placement. You are right now where you belong. You have everything you need to begin. We will walk it out together.

You are part of the redemptive movement of God in the world. For his daughters and his sons. For the healing of creation. For the coming of the Kingdom.

You and me---we are kingdom people. An outpost of redemption. Engaged in God's mission of reconciliation.

When you feel futile, small, ridiculous---remember: you will never, never, never give up. When you are tired, bored, discouraged, frustrated---remember: "The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it" (1 Thessalonians 5:24, NIV), for "he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus" (Philippians 1:6, NIV).

## Peace Be With You

We've traveled a long road together.

From Genesis to now. From "in the beginning" to "you are here." Through tragedy and hope, loss and recovery, exile and homecoming.

This book ends not with a conclusion but with a commissioning. Not with analysis but with blessing. Not with information but with transformation.

You have been equipped. You have been encouraged. You have been sent.

So go.

The church of Jesus Christ is broken and beautiful, failing and faithful, a mess and a miracle. It needs you. Not a perfected version of you---you, as you are, with your doubts and your gifts and your particular place in the story.

The Kingdom of God is already here, already breaking through, already making all things new. And you are invited---more than invited, commissioned---to participate in its coming.

Blessed be his Kingdom, now and forevermore.

Peace be with you, my friend.

Peace.
