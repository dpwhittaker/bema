# Chapter 3: When Empire Claimed the Church

## The End of Running

For three centuries, Christians ran.

They gathered in secret, worshiped in catacombs, and passed their faith to the next generation in whispered conversations. As Jesus had warned, "They will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake" (Matthew 24:9, ESV). They were hunted by emperors, denounced by neighbors, fed to lions for the entertainment of Roman crowds. To be a Christian was to accept that any day might be your last, that the knock on the door might bring soldiers, that your confession of "Jesus is Lord" might cost you everything.

And yet they grew. Despite the persecution---or perhaps because of it---the movement spread. By the early fourth century, scholars estimate that more than eighty percent of the Roman Empire had embraced the Christian faith. The most powerful civilization in human history was being transformed from within, one convert at a time, one act of radical love at a time.

The empire was crumbling, but not from barbarian invasion. It was crumbling because a Jewish carpenter from Nazareth had captured the hearts of Caesar's subjects.

And then came Constantine.

## The Vision at Milvian Bridge

In AD 312, Constantine found himself in a desperate situation. He was battling for control of a strategic bridge outside Rome, facing overwhelming odds. If the bridge fell, Rome itself would soon follow. His options were grim: retreat and lose everything, surrender and face execution, or fight and die.

Then, according to the accounts that have come down to us, something happened. Constantine had a vision.

The details vary depending on which ancient source you consult. Lactantius tells one version; Eusebius tells another. But the core remains consistent: Constantine saw a symbol---the Greek letters Chi and Rho, the first two letters of "Christ"---and heard words that would change history: "In this sign, conquer."

Constantine ordered the symbol painted on his soldiers' shields. Against all odds, he won the battle. And he credited his victory to the Christian God.

What are we to make of this moment? Historians have proposed several interpretations.

Some argue that Constantine's vision was entirely genuine, a true conversion experience that brought the emperor to sincere faith. If so, then Milvian Bridge was one of the most consequential spiritual encounters in human history.

Others see political calculation at work. Constantine was shrewd enough to read the demographic writing on the wall. With eighty percent of the empire already Christian, aligning himself with the Jesus movement was simply good politics. His father, Chlorus, had claimed to be an incarnation of Mithra---the fastest-growing religion after Christianity---and had celebrated his birthday on December 25 (the origin, incidentally, of that date's eventual association with Christ's birth). Perhaps Constantine was simply synchronizing his father's religious strategy with the new Christian majority.

Still others suggest a combination: genuine experience interpreted through political instinct. Perhaps Constantine really did have a spiritual encounter, but his understanding of what it meant was filtered through his imperial worldview. "In this sign, conquer" is not exactly the Sermon on the Mount.

And some wonder if Constantine simply misunderstood. Perhaps God really was speaking to him, but what God meant and what Constantine heard were very different things. Jesus had consistently rejected the weapons of empire. As he told Pilate, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting" (John 18:36, ESV). Yet here was Constantine taking the symbol of Christ and painting it on the shields of soldiers about to kill other human beings.

Whatever the truth, the consequences are clear. Constantine won. He became the last Roman emperor with singular control over the entire empire. And Christianity would never be the same.

## What Constantine Actually Did

There is a common misconception that Constantine made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. This is not quite accurate.

What Constantine did was make Christianity legal. With the Edict of Milan in AD 313, he ended the persecutions. Christians no longer had to run. They could worship openly, build churches, and practice their faith without fear of state violence.

This was, on the face of it, an unambiguous good. The running was over. The hiding was over. The martyrdoms, at least from Roman hands, were over. Christians could finally breathe.

But freedom is a double-edged sword.

It was actually Theodosius, later in the fourth century, who made Christianity truly advantageous. Under his reign, claiming Christian faith brought tangible benefits---political favor, social advancement, economic opportunity. Christianity was no longer simply legal; it was the path to power.

And that changed everything.

## The Flood of Convenience Converts

When Christianity was dangerous, only the truly committed would embrace it. You did not casually decide to become a Christian when that decision might get you killed. The early church was small, intense, and radically devoted precisely because the cost of membership was so high.

But when Christianity became not just safe but advantageous, the calculus shifted entirely.

Suddenly, everyone wanted to be a Christian. Roman elites saw the faith as a strategic opportunity---a way to position themselves for advancement in the new political order. One historian has described Christianity in this period as "a fad among the Roman elite." It was fashionable. It was useful. It was the smart career move.

The churches that had gathered in catacombs now gathered in basilicas. The communities that had numbered in dozens now numbered in thousands. The movement that had been forged in persecution was now flooded with people who had never paid any price for their faith and had no intention of doing so.

The early church had developed practices to guard against exactly this kind of dilution. The *Didache*, an early Christian manual, required new converts to swear off their old pagan ways before being baptized. There was a process of formation, a period of preparation, a genuine dying to the old life before being raised to the new. Gentiles who wished to join the community were expected to be adopted into a new family, a new worldview, a new way of life.

But you cannot maintain that kind of intensive formation when thousands are flooding through the doors. The *Didache* was quietly set aside. The standards were lowered. Christianity became something you could add to your Roman identity rather than something that replaced it entirely.

The faith was spreading. But was it still the faith?

## The Return of the Gnostic Crisis

Remember that the church had been dealing with the Gnostic crisis since the second-century schism with Judaism. Cut off from their Jewish teachers and their Hebraic worldview, Gentile Christians had absorbed the dualistic philosophy of their Hellenistic culture. Spirit was good; matter was bad. Heaven was the goal; earth was merely the prison. The body was a cage for the soul.

During the centuries of persecution, these theological problems had remained on the back burner. When you are running for your life, you do not have time for philosophical speculation. The pressing question is not "What is the nature of Christ's divinity?" but "Where can I hide my family?"

But now, with persecution ended and Christianity legal, these questions came roaring back. And they came with devastating force.

Was Jesus truly God? Or was he a created being, similar to God but not identical? Was Jesus truly human? Or did he only appear to have a body while actually being pure spirit? If he was both God and human, how did that work? Was he two persons inhabiting one body? Was he half God and half human? What percentage of each?

These questions may sound abstract, but they had profound practical implications. If Jesus was not truly human, then his life cannot be a model for ours. If Jesus was not truly divine, then his sacrifice cannot save us. If Christianity cannot give a coherent account of who Jesus was, then the entire faith collapses into incoherence.

The problem was that the Gentile church no longer had the tools to answer these questions well.

The Jewish believers had received the Torah at Sinai---"The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb" (Deuteronomy 5:2, NIV)---and then spent forty years in the wilderness learning what it meant. They had generations of accumulated wisdom, a methodology for wrestling with sacred texts, a tradition of binding and loosing that allowed communities to apply ancient truth to new situations. When difficult questions arose, they knew how to think about them.

The Gentile church had none of this. They had been cut off from their Jewish roots. They had lost the walking libraries of Torah. They were trying to navigate complex theological questions using Greek philosophical categories that were fundamentally alien to the Hebraic worldview of Scripture.

And now there were floods of new converts who had no investment in getting the answers right---they just wanted the social benefits of claiming the Christian name.

The result was theological chaos.

## The Four Great Councils

The church responded to this chaos by convening councils---large gatherings of bishops and theologians who would debate the contested questions and render authoritative decisions. The model was ancient. The Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 had shown that the church could gather, deliberate, and reach consensus under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Now that same model would be applied to the Christological controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries.

Four councils stand out as particularly significant.

The Council of Nicaea, convened by Constantine himself in AD 325, addressed the question of Christ's divinity. A teacher named Arius had been arguing that Christ was a created being---like God, but not truly God. "There was a time when the Son was not," Arius taught. The council rejected this view as heresy and produced the first version of what we now call the Nicene Creed. Christ is "of one substance with the Father," the council declared. Not similar to God, but truly God.

The Council of Constantinople in AD 381, convened by Theodosius I, addressed the opposite question: Christ's humanity. A teacher named Apollinaris had been arguing that Christ was not truly human---that his divine nature had somehow replaced his human mind or soul. The council rejected this view as heresy and expanded the Nicene Creed to affirm both Christ's full divinity and his full humanity.

The Council of Ephesus in AD 431, convened by Theodosius II, addressed the unity of Christ's person. A teacher named Nestorius had been arguing that Christ was essentially two persons inhabiting one body---a divine person and a human person, separate but coexisting. The council rejected this view as heresy and declared that Christ is one person at all times, not two persons awkwardly sharing space.

The Council of Chalcedon in AD 451 brought all of these threads together and addressed the final question: If Christ is fully divine and fully human, existing as one person, what is the relationship between these natures? A teacher named Eutyches had been arguing that Christ's two natures were blended together, so that he was neither fully God nor fully human but some kind of mixture. The council rejected this view as heresy and articulated what has come to be called the hypostatic union: Christ is simultaneously one hundred percent God and one hundred percent human, two complete natures united in one person, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.

The councils had done important work. They had drawn boundaries around Christian belief, excluding teachings that would have fatally compromised the faith. They had given Christians a shared vocabulary for talking about the mysteries at the heart of their confession. They had demonstrated that the church could still engage in communal discernment, even without its Jewish foundation.

But something had been lost in the process.

## Orthodoxy Over Orthopraxy

The councils focused on right belief---what theologians call *orthodoxy*. They asked, "What must we think about Christ?" and produced creeds and definitions and categories.

There is nothing wrong with right belief. What we think about Jesus matters enormously. The councils were not wasting their time.

But the councils largely ignored right practice---what theologians call *orthopraxy*. They did not ask, "How must we live as followers of Christ?" They did not produce guidelines for blessing the nations, for caring for the poor, for subverting empire with enemy-love. Those concerns seemed to have faded into the background.

Consider what had occupied the early church. They had been consumed with the question of how to bless all nations, fulfilling the promise to Abraham: "All peoples on earth will be blessed through you" (Genesis 12:3, NIV). They had been positioned at the crossroads of the earth, called to be a light to the Gentiles. They had practiced *tikkun olam*, the repair of the world, believing that their obedience was somehow speeding the coming of God's kingdom.

Now, three centuries later, the church was consumed with philosophical debates about hypostatic unions.

This is not to say those debates were unimportant. The Gnostic crisis had forced the questions, and they demanded answers. But something about the emphasis had shifted. Christianity was becoming a set of ideas to be affirmed rather than a way of life to be embodied.

The narrative of Scripture---partnership with God, blessing the nations, repairing the world---was being replaced by philosophical categories borrowed from Athens. The rabbinic method of wrestling with text in community was being replaced by authoritative pronouncements from imperial councils. The embodied practice of following Jesus was being replaced by abstract affirmations about Jesus.

We had gained orthodoxy. But we had lost the plot.

## The Counterfactual Question

Here we must pause and ask a question that cannot be answered but must be asked: Would any of this have been necessary if the schism had never happened?

Imagine a world where Gentile Christians had stood with their Jewish brothers and sisters in the second century. Imagine that the connection to Torah had never been severed, that the walking libraries of Scripture had continued to teach and guide the Gentile church, that the Hebraic worldview had remained the foundation of Christian thought.

Would Gnosticism have gained such a foothold in a community still anchored to Jewish creation theology, with its insistence that the material world is good?

Would the Christological controversies have raged so fiercely in a community that still practiced binding and loosing, that knew how to hold tension without demanding precise philosophical resolution?

Would the shift from orthopraxy to orthodoxy have happened in a community still focused on *tikkun olam*, still believing that their embodied faithfulness was speeding the coming of God's kingdom?

We cannot know. History only flows in one direction. But the question haunts us. Perhaps all those centuries of councils and creeds and controversies were an attempt to solve problems that should never have existed---problems that arose precisely because we had cut ourselves off from our roots.

## The Slide We Never Recovered From

Looking back at this period with the benefit of hindsight, a pattern emerges that will repeat itself throughout the rest of church history.

When Christianity gained power, it lost something essential. When it became advantageous to be a Christian, the community was flooded with people who wanted the benefits without the cost. When persecution ended, theological drift accelerated. When the church aligned with empire, it began to look more like empire than like the kingdom Jesus proclaimed.

This is not to say that everything after Constantine was decline. There were saints in every century, faithful communities in every generation, moments of genuine renewal and reform. The Spirit of God was not absent from the imperial church, and we should not pretend otherwise.

But something went wrong in the fourth century that we have never fully corrected. The church became Christendom---Christianity expressed through imperial power and institutional authority. The persecuted minority became the persecuting majority. The community that had subverted empire learned to wield empire. The movement that had followed a crucified rabbi began to carry the sword.

Constantine thought he was saving Christianity. And in some ways, perhaps he was. But he also transformed it into something that Jesus might not have recognized.

"In this sign, conquer," Constantine heard. But the sign of Christ was a cross---an instrument of imperial execution turned into a symbol of self-giving love. Jesus had said, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me" (Matthew 16:24, NIV). To conquer in that sign should have meant something very different from painting it on the shields of soldiers.

## The Fall of Rome

By the end of the fifth century, Rome was finished.

The fall was not sudden. The writing had been on the wall for centuries. The empire had grown too large to govern, too diverse to unify, too corrupt to sustain itself. The strong central authority that had held everything together kept fragmenting into competing factions. The military that had once conquered the world could no longer defend its own borders.

The parallel to the biblical narrative is striking. When Herod the Great died, his kingdom was split into three parts, each ruled by one of his sons, each weaker than the whole had been. Rome suffered the same fate. The great empire splintered, and the fragments could not hold.

In the East, what remained of Roman power continued under a new name: the Byzantine Empire. Greek in culture, Christian in confession, it would endure for another thousand years until the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453.

But the West fell into chaos. The unity that Rome had imposed by force was gone. Local warlords and Germanic tribes carved the former provinces into patchwork kingdoms. The roads and aqueducts that had connected the empire began to crumble. The great cities shrank. The sophisticated bureaucracy collapsed.

And the church was left to pick up the pieces.

## Christendom Rises

In the vacuum left by Rome's fall, the church became the only remaining institution with reach and resources. Bishops became de facto governors. Monasteries became centers of learning. The church preserved literacy, maintained what infrastructure it could, and provided the only framework of meaning in a world that seemed to be ending.

This is the beginning of what historians call Christendom---a period lasting roughly from the fourth century to the French Revolution, during which church and state were intertwined as two aspects of a single Christian society. The church provided spiritual legitimacy; the state provided temporal power. Each supported the other, and neither could imagine existing without the other.

Christendom had its virtues. It preserved learning through the so-called Dark Ages (which were not nearly as dark as their name suggests). It built hospitals and schools and churches. It provided a shared moral vocabulary that crossed ethnic and linguistic boundaries. It created some of the most magnificent art and architecture the world has ever seen.

But Christendom also had a shadow side. When church and state are fused, the church becomes an instrument of state power---or the state becomes an instrument of church power. Dissent becomes not just heresy but treason. Force becomes not just the state's tool but the church's. The cross, which should have symbolized suffering love, becomes a symbol of conquest and coercion.

The church had been birthed in opposition to empire. It had grown precisely because it was different from the powers that ruled the world. Its founder had rejected the temptation to seize political power---when Satan "showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor" and offered them in exchange for worship, Jesus replied, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'" (Matthew 4:8-10, NIV). Its earliest members had died rather than bow to Caesar.

Now the church was Caesar. Or at least, it was so entangled with Caesar that the distinction had become meaningless.

## A Word of Hope

The story we have told in this chapter is largely a story of loss. The church lost its outsider status. It lost its distinctive witness. It lost its connection to its Jewish roots. It lost its focus on embodied practice in favor of abstract belief. It lost, in some ways, the gospel itself.

But this is not the end of the story.

Throughout the centuries covered in this chapter, there were faithful Christians who remembered what the church was supposed to be. There were communities that resisted the pull of power. There were teachers who held onto orthopraxy even as orthodoxy dominated the councils. There were martyrs who died not at the hands of Rome but at the hands of the imperial church, refusing to bow to a Christendom that had betrayed its origins.

The Spirit of God was still at work. The story was not over. The plot had been lost, but it had not been destroyed beyond recovery.

In the chapters that follow, we will trace how the church continued to struggle with the tension between kingdom and empire, between the way of Jesus and the way of Constantine. We will see moments of recovery and renewal alongside continued drift and decline. We will find both tragedy and hope in equal measure.

But we must never forget what happened in the fourth century. When empire claimed the church, the church was transformed. It gained power and lost its soul. It gained buildings and lost its way. It gained the world and lost the plot.

The question that will echo through the rest of our story is whether we can ever find our way back.
