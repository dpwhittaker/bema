# Chapter 10: From Fundamentalism to the Future

The 1920s left American Christianity locked in a fierce battle. On one side stood fundamentalism---militant, defensive, certain that modernism and secular humanism threatened everything Christians held dear. On the other side stood theological liberalism---intellectual, accommodating, eager to reconcile faith with modern thought. For an entire generation, these seemed like the only two options.

And both of them, it turns out, were deeply flawed.

## Two Bad Options

Fundamentalism, for all its passion for Scripture and its genuine love for Jesus, had calcified into something brittle. It defined itself by what it opposed rather than what it affirmed. It treated every question as a threat, every doubt as a sign of spiritual failure, every disagreement as potential heresy. In its zeal to protect the faith, it often crushed the very curiosity and honesty that healthy faith requires.

Theological liberalism, meanwhile, had drifted so far toward accommodation that it sometimes seemed like little more than secular humanism with Jesus "slapped on the label." In its eagerness to be intellectually respectable, it often emptied the gospel of its supernatural content. The miracles became metaphors. The resurrection became a symbol. The distinctive claims of Christianity dissolved into generic spirituality and social ethics.

For millions of Christians navigating the early twentieth century, these were the only options on the table. You could be a fundamentalist who rejected modern thought wholesale. Or you could be a liberal who sacrificed theological substance for cultural acceptance. The middle ground had vanished.

Looking back now, with the benefit of hindsight, both options seem equally problematic. The fundamentalists were right that Christianity makes specific claims that can't be endlessly diluted. The liberals were right that faith must engage honestly with new knowledge. But each side, in its reaction against the other, became a distorted version of itself.

This is the tragedy of reactionary movements: they define themselves by their enemies rather than by their positive vision. Fundamentalism became anti-modernism. Liberalism became anti-fundamentalism. And the rich, complex, life-giving tradition of Christian faith---which had always included both conviction and inquiry, both certainty and mystery---got lost in the crossfire.

## The World Breaks

Then came the 1930s and 1940s. And the world shattered.

The twentieth century had dawned with extraordinary optimism. Science was advancing. Democracy was spreading. Reason was triumphing over superstition. Surely, given enough time, humanity would solve its problems. The arc of history bent toward progress. Utopia was just around the corner.

Then came the Great Depression. Then came fascism. Then came Stalin's purges. Then came the systematic extermination of six million Jews and millions of others in the Holocaust. Then came the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Any hope that humanity could usher in some kind of utopian existence---whether through fascist order, communist revolution, or democratic progress---came crashing down. Every humanistic worldview showed its dark potential: unimaginable genocide, totalitarian oppression, nuclear annihilation. The optimism of the early century lay in ruins.

The simple conclusion was devastating: humanity isn't as great as we thought it was.

This shattering of humanistic optimism created an unexpected opening for Christianity. The secular alternatives had shown their limits. Reason alone couldn't save us. Political systems, left to themselves, produced horrors. Science, divorced from ethics, built weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps there was something to this ancient faith after all---something about human fallenness, about the need for grace, about transcendent standards that stood in judgment over human schemes.

Christianity experienced what can only be described as a "great and sudden turnaround." Out of the ashes of World War II emerged a new movement: modern evangelicalism.

## The Rise of Modern Evangelicalism

Evangelicalism emerged as a "broader, softer version" of fundamentalism. It retained fundamentalism's core commitments: the authority of Scripture, the necessity of personal conversion, the reality of Christ's atoning death and resurrection. But it shed some of fundamentalism's harshest edges. It was willing to engage with culture rather than merely condemn it. It valued education and intellectual engagement. It sought to present the gospel winsome, not just defensively.

This movement would come to be associated with two of the greatest evangelists of the modern era: Billy Graham and Bill Bright.

Billy Graham became perhaps the most famous preacher in history. His crusades filled stadiums across the world. His message was simple, direct, urgent: You can have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. He navigated an incredibly complex era---the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movement, the cultural upheavals of the 1960s---while maintaining a remarkably consistent focus on the gospel. Whatever criticisms might be leveled at his approach, his impact was undeniable. Millions came to faith through his ministry.

Bill Bright founded Campus Crusade for Christ (now known simply as Cru) and developed something that would prove enormously influential: The Four Spiritual Laws. This simple tract reduced the gospel to four clear propositions that anyone could understand and anyone could share. God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. Man is sinful and separated from God. Jesus Christ is God's only provision for man's sin. We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.

The theological merits of this formulation can be debated. It's certainly a simplification---some would say an oversimplification---of the gospel's rich complexity. But its practical effect was revolutionary. For the first time in history, ordinary Christians had a tool for sharing their faith that didn't require seminary training or pastoral authority. The soccer mom, the college student, the factory worker---anyone could explain the gospel in simple language. Evangelism was democratized.

History may look back on this era---the Billy Graham crusades, the Four Spiritual Laws, the explosion of evangelical publishing and broadcasting---with a similar perspective to how we view the printing press or the Reformation. These were world-changing developments. They reshaped how Christianity operated in the modern world.

## The Jesus Movement

The 1970s brought another wave of spiritual awakening: the Jesus Movement. Young people across America, often coming from the counterculture of the 1960s, discovered a living faith in Jesus Christ. The movement was marked by contemporary music, informal worship, and an emphasis on personal relationship with God. "Jesus the Christ is living inside of me"---this became the anthem of a generation.

The Jesus Movement wasn't sophisticated theologically. It sometimes lacked depth. But it represented something genuine: a generation encountering the risen Christ and being transformed. Many of today's older evangelical leaders came to faith in this season. They are, in a sense, "children of the Jesus Movement."

This movement reminded the church of something it perpetually forgets: each generation needs its own encounter with God. The faith of our parents, however genuine, cannot substitute for our own living relationship with Christ. Every generation needs revival.

## A Revolution in the Academy

While revival was happening in crusade tents and college campuses, something else was happening in the academy---something that would prove equally significant for the future of Christianity, though few recognized it at the time.

His name was Jacob Neusner.

Neusner was a Jewish literary scholar with Orthodox roots. He was not a Christian believer. But in the 1970s, he began a project that would change biblical scholarship forever: he brought modern Christian scholars to the table to study Judaism and Christianity together.

This might not sound revolutionary. But consider what it meant. For nearly 1,800 years---ever since the catastrophic schism in the early second century---Jewish and Christian scholars had pursued their work in almost complete isolation from each other. Christians studied the New Testament without understanding its Jewish context. Jews studied their own tradition without engaging Christian scholarship. The two streams flowed separately, never mixing.

Neusner changed that. He brought Catholic and Protestant scholars into conversation with Jewish experts. And what they discovered was extraordinary: Christian scholars had been missing crucial insights that only their Jewish counterparts could provide. The first-century Jewish world---its assumptions, its practices, its ways of reading Scripture---had been invisible to centuries of Christian interpretation.

Academic Christians would never again engage in biblical research or archaeology without the aid of their Jewish brothers. The schism that had fractured the Jesus movement in the second century began, finally, to be addressed---at least in the academy.

This is worth pausing to absorb. We never repaired that schism for 1,800 years. We went down our own stream of consciousness, developed our own theological frameworks, held our own councils and reformations. But they were all very Gentile. We had lost connection to the Jewish roots of our faith, and we didn't even know what we were missing.

Now, 1,800 years later, Jewish and Gentile worlds collided again---not in the church, but in the seminar room. Scholars looked at each other and realized: there are basic questions we never thought to ask. Insights that had been obvious to first-century Jews had become invisible to us because we had no Jewish conversation partners.

Why didn't we know these things? Sometimes the answer is simply: we never asked. Until the work of Neusner and others, Christendom had been so focused on doctrinal purity and theological correctness that it never asked basic questions about the Bible's Jewish context.

The BEMA approach to Scripture---reading the Bible through first-century Jewish eyes, attending to context and culture, discovering insights that centuries of Gentile interpretation had missed---this whole discussion would not happen without the work of Jacob Neusner. Period.

## N.T. Wright and Kingdom Theology

By the turn of the twenty-first century, the fruits of this Jewish-Christian scholarly collaboration were beginning to reach the church. And the most influential voice in this transmission was N.T. Wright.

Wright, a British New Testament scholar and Anglican bishop, stands on the shoulders of the conversation Neusner started. He brought a fresh set of questions to the text: What did Jesus actually mean by "the Kingdom of God"? How did first-century Jews understand messianic hope? What was the political and social context of Jesus's ministry?

Wright's work has transformed evangelical theology. The Kingdom of God, it turns out, wasn't primarily about going to heaven when you die. It was about God's reign breaking into the present world, setting things right, inaugurating the new creation. As Jesus taught his disciples to pray: "Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10, NIV). Jesus wasn't offering an escape from earth but a transformation of it. The gospel wasn't just personal salvation but cosmic restoration.

This Kingdom theology movement has reshaped how many Christians understand the gospel, the church, and their responsibility in the world. It has restored a sense of mission that extends beyond individual soul-winning to include justice, creation care, and social transformation.

Twenty to thirty years---that's how long scholars used to say it took for academic discoveries to reach the church. First, discoveries would be vetted by the academy. Then they'd be taught in universities and seminaries. Then pastors would learn them in their training. Then, finally, those pastors would share them from pulpits and in books.

But the internet has changed everything. Information---good and bad---now spreads exponentially faster. The curve is shortening, speeding up. What once took forty years can now happen in ten. This is both opportunity and danger. But it means that the insights from Jewish-Christian scholarly collaboration are reaching everyday believers faster than ever before.

## Quantum Reality and the Shattering of Certainty

While theologians were rediscovering Jewish context, scientists were making discoveries that would shake the modern worldview to its foundations.

Quantum physics revealed that at the most fundamental level of reality, the rules change. The tidy Newtonian universe---where everything followed predictable laws, where given enough information you could calculate any outcome---dissolved into a realm of probability waves, uncertainty principles, and particles that seemed to exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed.

The scientific world reeled at the implications. The most basic principles of physics no longer applied at the quantum level. The universe was stranger, more mysterious, more resistant to human comprehension than the Enlightenment had imagined.

Combined with the sociological devastation of the twentieth century---the wars, the genocides, the failed utopian experiments---quantum science contributed to a massive worldview shift. The confident certainties of secular humanism took a major hit. If the physical universe itself resisted complete explanation, perhaps human reason wasn't as reliable a guide as we thought.

This shift created what we now call postmodernity.

## The Emerging Church and Its Legacy

By the late 1990s, a cultural cry was rising: "What do we truly know anyway?"

Across society---in politics, science, philosophy---the absolutes that the modern world had taken for granted were being questioned. Maybe there wasn't one objective truth that everyone could access through reason. Maybe all knowledge was perspectival, shaped by culture and context. Maybe certainty was impossible.

The church's response was, predictably, hostile. Evangelicalism raged against what it perceived as "moral relativism." If there's no objective truth, how can the gospel be true? If everything is interpretation, what happens to biblical authority? Postmodernity was labeled an enemy, a threat, a sign of cultural decay.

But some progressive evangelicals saw something different. They recognized that postmodern questions weren't necessarily attacks on faith. Sometimes they were honest admissions of human limitation. And they attempted to bring the gospel back into cultural conversation by engaging with postmodern sensibilities rather than simply condemning them.

This became known as the Emerging Church.

The Emerging Church was never a unified movement. It included a diverse range of voices, some more faithful to historic Christianity than others. It was characterized by experimental worship, decentralized leadership, honest acknowledgment of doubt, and openness to mystery. For many evangelicals, it was the "den of iniquity and spawn of Satan himself"---a dangerous compromise with the spirit of the age.

Largely rejected by mainstream evangelicalism, the Emerging Church is no longer considered a viable approach. It has morphed and evolved into other forms. But looking back, we can see that it started important conversations. It prepared the church for survival in a changing world. Even movements that fail can plant seeds that bear fruit later.

## Today: Decentralized Everything

And so we arrive at the present moment.

The world of the early twenty-first century would be unrecognizable to previous generations. Decentralized platforms have reshaped every industry: Uber disrupted transportation, Airbnb disrupted hospitality, social media disrupted communication. Traditional hierarchies and institutions are crumbling across society.

The church exists in this environment too. Old models of centralized denominational authority make less and less sense. New models are emerging---podcasts, online communities, networks of small groups that span continents. The very idea of "church" is being renegotiated in real time.

What does this mean for Christianity? Hard to say. We're too close to the present moment to understand it fully. But certain trends are clear.

The culture wars that have defined evangelical Christianity for the past half-century are either sociological puberty or death throes---either the awkward growing pains of a movement finding its way or the final gasps of a movement whose time has passed. Perhaps both, in different parts of the church.

The old fundamentalist-liberal binary has broken down. Younger Christians often refuse to choose between intellectual honesty and genuine faith. They want both. They're allergic to culture war rhetoric but also unsatisfied with theological vapidity. They're searching for something deeper.

We have not figured out how to respond well to post-Christian culture. We're still in denial about it. We speak sometimes about living in a "post-Christian" society, but our strategies and assumptions still presuppose Christendom---a world where Christianity is the default, where churches have social privilege, where biblical literacy can be assumed. That world is gone. We haven't accepted it yet.

And yet.

## Every Generation Is Perfectly Placed

Here is the word of hope that keeps this from becoming despair: every generation finds itself perfectly placed for the future.

We stand at a unique moment in history. For 1,800 years, Jewish and Christian scholarship pursued separate paths. Now they're reconnecting. For centuries, ordinary Christians had limited access to biblical scholarship. Now the internet puts a seminary's worth of resources at anyone's fingertips. For generations, the church was in denial about the post-Christian shift. Now that denial is breaking down, creating space for honest engagement.

The twentieth century brought unimaginable tragedy: world wars, genocide, nuclear terror. But it also brought unexpected gifts: the Billy Graham era's democratization of evangelism, the Jesus Movement's spiritual renewal, Jacob Neusner's revolutionary collaboration, N.T. Wright's Kingdom theology.

The collision of Jewish and Christian scholarship---the reconnection of worlds that had been separated since the second century---makes new understanding possible that wasn't possible before. We can read the Bible with fresh eyes. We can recover insights that our spiritual ancestors couldn't access. We can learn from our history instead of merely repeating it.

This is the extraordinary moment we inhabit. Yes, the challenges are real. The fragmentation is painful. The culture wars are exhausting. The post-Christian reality is disorienting.

But God has placed us here for such a time as this. As Mordecai said to Esther, "And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" (Esther 4:14, NIV).

The question is not whether this moment is perfect---it isn't. The question is whether we will rise to meet it. Whether we will learn from the disasters of the past. Whether we will receive the gifts that previous generations couldn't access. Whether we will be faithful where we are, with what we have, in the time we've been given.

The twentieth century is behind us. Its mistakes and its gifts are our inheritance. What we do with that inheritance---that's our work. And that work begins, as it always begins, with understanding where we are and what we've been given.

Which brings us to the heart of the matter: What exactly did we lose? And what, if anything, can we recover?
